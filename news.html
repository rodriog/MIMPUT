		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">NEWS and GENERAL INFO:</span></h3>
			<b>-12th april 2017</b> : TF PEACH model (TripFlip HourGlass shaped Peach) complete (design phase)! Now its MY TIME to PUT her in the game. It might take a week or two. Also, Level 8-2 ALMOST done. Pointy (from Yoshi island) will also be on it. Revamped 'brown rock walls' from Biles! And a new Scene from Blargh (DoopLiss from Paper Mario2!) All of these to be uploaded soon!
			<br/><b>-1st april 2017</b> : New Aedler site (faster than aedler.com site), that has Issue Tracker support (you are accessing it right now) :D - thank you <b>OverLord</b>!) Also, Remember that, in order for me to fix a given bug quickly, just use DEBUG mode (PAGE DOWN key) before reproducing the bug and take a screen shot of the screen, THEN another screenshot of your OPTIONS screen. Better if recording a short video just before the bug happening, or a detailed description. Please register those info in the ISSUE link in the menu above! Thank you!
			<br/><b>-27th march 2017</b> : The game is back to LOK (still 3.29). My internet is back (it was off since a week ago) and  my vacation ENDED. We may see many updates soon. Aedler.com site is still OFF until I fix it.
			<br/><b>-26th february 2017:</b> I'm on my vacation! I generally work more in the game during it, until 22th of march. I am creating level 8-2 and some features.
			<br/><b>-29th january 2017:</b> Bowser Castle level fully done! Many features like an elevator based on New Bowser Castle by Playshapes. Final scenes with Bowser and even Shadow Queen still to be finished by Blargh, though!
			<br/><b>-28th january 2017:</b> I've been offline for a week due to internet problems, but I am okay. It's rare to be away from LOK, but if this happens (provided I am not dead 
			<img src="https://html-online.com/editor/tinymce/plugins/emoticons/img/smiley-innocent.gif" alt="innocent" />), I generally come back. Generally it can last up to 10 days for 2 or 3 times in the year. If more than 1 month, you can be worried a bit. If not, please have patience. Just be aware of this.
			<br/><b>-11th december 2016:</b> XML of Portuguese-BR language 100% complete! Fixed ShyGuy level BUG!
			<br/><b>-23th october 2016:</b> URGENT!! The game NOW supports ALL LATIN languages (with accents), Russian and certain countries like BieloRussia! (Cyrilic!) Except Greek (so far)
			<br/><b>-9th october 2016:</b> Huge XML process is COMPLETED! People who want to translate the game (as its now possible to load custom XML into it), please access my <a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/ivanaedler/MIMPUT" target="_blank">GITHUB!</a> 
			Be careful before just getting the XML or a given language and updating it because others can be doing the same! Avoid double work!

		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">VOTING POLLS RESULTS:</span></h3>
			<b>31th:</b> Almost 60% wants Mona as the next character, while 21% Wants Pauline, and the rest dont matter. 
			<br/><b>30th:</b> Almost half of people prefer toads immediatelly fucking Peach if she is a nymph, horny or drunk, but more than the other half finds it annoying in varying degrees, so I added  'Toads Able to Fuck her immediatelly' (YES/NO) in the options.
			<br/><b>29th:</b> Almost 60% dont care about 'asshole' synonyms Peach can use, and 31% 'wants it!' A minority thinks names like 'Derriere mouth', for example, are ugly. However I will do my best to use sexy names.
			<br/><b>28th:</b> 33% wants more Boo, Flurries, Bumpties and Nibble scenes.  20% wants Ninji, Lakitu and Monty Mole scenes. 15% prefer me to keep my own pace (like making levels).
			<br/><b>27th:</b> Opinion of current gameplay: 50% say its on average (they dont want easier or harder right now). And 35% dont care about it.
			<br/><b>26th:</b> Peach Virginity with friends: more than 60% prefer friends fucking her and taking out her virginity in later scenes (like scene 5 or later). Players can load a saved game anyway.
			<br/><b>25th:</b> From more than 250 people, 63% want a small pinky-red blood splat if she loses virginity, as an ON/OFF option.
			<br/><b>24th:</b> From 130 people, almost 100 prefer CatSuit than Tigeress. I will ADD CatSuit due to this.
			<br/><b>23th:</b> People want me to choose with whom Peach will take a bath with, in her castle. Second place: Peach and Krystal. So I decided to let Peach bathe herself, with the possibility to (NEW!) go to Toadella's bath, in the lower floor (New Peach Castle). 
			<br/><b>22th:</b> People want the PENGUIN powerup and ICE FLOWER powerup for Peach. The second group wants just ICE FLOWER. As the Penguin has been made, Ice flower can be made after Biker outfit, when we have world 6.
			<br/><b>21th:</b> People prefer Toads appearing in the grey castles and in some prisons/restraining areas along the levels. They dont like Toads appearing on airships as hostages.
			<br/><b>20th:</b> More than 60% prefer Character Select screen ONCE in the start, then Peach would need to go to her bathroom/closet to use this screen to change clothes. Only clothes alike can be changed (e.g. 'Dress types', 'Swimsuit types' and 'Sport types'). Until then, we can choose which outfit Peach will be in new powerups, in the 'Outfit Room' screen, at any time.
			<br/><b>19th:</b> People prefer BELOME with<b> 2 eyes</b> only and fangs (<b>almost 50%</b>). Normal 4 eyes: <b>34%</b>. 2 eyes with no fangs: <b>15%</b>.
			<br/><b>18th:</b> They prefer BIGGEST Chain Chomps, then MIDDLE size ones. <i>80 vs 51</i>
			<br/><b>17th:</b> Most people don't care about how many water levels the game will have. Some prefer only 2 levels in the entire game.
			<br/><b>16th:</b> People DO want Pregnant Peach (as an optional feature).<i>108 vs 57</i>
			<br/><b>15th:</b> Next enemy to be designed: <b>NIPPLER PLANTS</b>. Then, <b>CHARGING CHUCKS</b>. Then, <b>BOWSER JR</b> (Ok done! But not in the game yet).
			<br/><b>14th:</b> Name of DESERT WORLD:<b>Dry Dry Desert!</b> All other names could be used as level names.
			<br/><b>13th:</b> People want <b>more sex scenes</b>. 2nd: they want <b>more ENEMY characters</b>. 3nd: they <b>prefer me to choose</b>. Thank you!
			<br/><b>12th:</b> RAWK HAWK will have legs. <i>63 vs 15</i>
			<br/><b>11th:</b> "FLURRY HILLS" Win! (name of World 6).
			<br/><b>10th:</b> Peach crouching while in backside pose (showing her butt and nice bits) WIN! <i>58 vs 19 vs14</i>
			<br/><b>9th:</b> Young Peach Model was chosen! 96 vs 53. However, as there is more than 25% wanting Playshapes Peach back, I've put her too.
			<br/><b>8th:</b> PLOT #3 (airships and Kamek with aphrodisiac curse) WIN.
			<br/><b>7th:</b> Game name changed to PUT: Peach's Untold Tale.
			<br/><b>6th:</b> "Peach should be free (traversing blocks) only if they're already used (becoming solid) or if a special one (e.g. straw blocks), like Super Mario Bros 2" WIN!</b> <i>56 vs 25!</i>
			<br/><b>5th:</b> People who want peeing ability to Peach (with buttons like use/dont use toilet) WIN! <i>145 vs 66!</i>
			<br/><b>4th:</b> People who prefer Peach losing clothing parts instead of the entire powerup when she's hurt WIN! <i>92 vs 16!</i> Peach will lose the powerup, being stark naked, ONLY if she's hit while using the last clothing part.
			<br/><b>3rd:</b> People who prefer levels NOT being restarted WIN! <i>54 vs 5!</i>From now on, when Peach dies, the level will NOT be restarted, but powerups will. 
			<br/><b>2nd:</b> People still prefer Control Key for Jump! But this poll was cancelled because it was too few votes and several bugs appeared due to this being a browser short key!
			<br/><b>1st: </b>Birdo model by BILES was chosen!
