MARIO IS MISSING - Peach's Untold Tale CHANGELOG

AEDLER SITE (in case above is OFFLINE) - http://www.aedler.com/fora/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2

INFO: In case you can donate for me to have ways to continue the game and make more games! http://aedlerprogramming.blogspot.com.br/2014/10/donate-for-cause.html. 
Or in my Patreon site: https://www.patreon.com/aef22

This makes me more focused in the game, while improving code and art, making it even more clean and pleasurable. I usually buy coffee packs, pay my servers, skip a given daily job (what?) in order to implement 'Dat' cute scene earlier, and I do maintenance to the computers in order to keep working on it. FYI, each compile time can reach 30 minutes in a Core I7. 

INFO 2: Yes, I work in the game EVERYDAY. Exceptions may occur (a 5-day holiday, etc). I generally inform this in LOK site.
INFO 3: The game has around 41200 lines of ECMA ActionScript code so far! 
SPEED: in 'highest graphics', default options, the game runs between 16fps and 17fps in most levels on a Core i5, and more than 23fps on a Core i7). The game engine runs at 26FPS max. You can optimize this further in the OPTIONS screen, like normal or low quality mode, FPS skip modes, stationary cameras, etc.

INFO 4: Its really interesting to read the changelog. This might be one of the largest and relentless changelogs in the world (if not already) :P  You can even imagine playing an earlier version by reading it backwards, and you might give more value to the game, which is already massive. For example, in update 2.0.17, Peach could only enter in Mario's Pad (no scenes yet, and no mushroom dicks yet).

INFO 5: I want to keep working until having all 8 worlds, Mario in the prison getting saved, more endings, more enemies and scenes!

INFO 6: The chosen playable Princess can be 'always innocent' in the game (if ON) but this doesnt mean she wont be 'asking for a rub' in certain scenes, like with Koopalings. Thats because in Boss scenes, when the princess is catched up, she really needs to survive, so she needs to tease him/her in order to beat him/her by fatigue. So there are three kinds of dialogues: Whether she is Virgin, Whether she was fucked at least once, and Whether a Nymph/Whore. Being Innocent can allow the first and second options, according to her virginity. So, a 'pure innocent talk' will only happen if she is virgin, and even in that state, she will be suggesting sex (implicit or not), because she was discovering herself (kisses, licking, rubbing..) with toads before the game started!

INFO 7: I call harmless/not game breaking bugs as GLITCHES.
Thank you for enjoying the game! 

- PLEASE PAY ATTENTION to certain browsers (like CHROME) and latest Flash versions (like 20). It MAY make the game crash or give many strange bugs! At first, try to clean all your flash/browser cache, then try another browser or a former Flash Version, like 12. The game was started using Flash Player 10, and I tried my most to retain that compatibility, although I am now targetting Flash 16 and 17.

===============================================
Update 3.39 (9th July 2017)
- Please reload an external XML (english or other) to refresh the language of the game! Use the ones in my GITHUB (https://github.com/ivanaedler/MIMPUT/). Or you can just click RESET SAVES in the first screen if you dont have saved games and you dont want to mess around the XML files (English only!)
- NEW: Luma scene 3 by Blargh!
- NEW: A REAL ponytail to Peachy! (like when Peach playing in a tennis court)
- NEW: You can change her ponytail style (normal or ponytail) in her drawer next to her bathroom (you will see a 'MAKEUP' text in the drawer). If ponytail was selected, this hair state will only change back to normal if you lose a life or get a Shadow Queen outfit.
- NEW: You can change other princesses' NPC belly and boobs in the Options (below Boobies/Belly header)! Daisy, Rosalina, Shygirl, Mona and Pauline are there (only Daisy and Shygirl is available so far).
- Added all the three Lumas scenes to 'Friends' Gallery.
- IMPROVED classic masturbation. No more 'two masturbation types' at random. Now, every time you press the masturbation key or if she does it automatically when a nymph, she will engage on it by those rules: If NOT a nymph, or NOT horny enough, she will start by looking left/right (as she is embarrassed). If she is Daisy, or already a nymph, but not horny enough, she will tenderly touch her insides, touching/rubbing them a bit, then sniffing it. If horny enough (say, 50%), she will engage in a more directly masturbation (the classic one we know since the early versions), until falling while cumming. No more 'dumb/slow sniffing alternative pose', where the player used to get annoyed because she do it slow in order to cum, and with just two repetitive loops. Before, we needed to press the masturbation button again and again until getting the classic masturbation action.
- Rule Change: when taking a new powerup, the princess wont have her (erhm) little perverted asshole back to normal anymore (if swollen due to sex). You have to lose a life to get it back.
- Rule Change: instead of 'Fart Sounds' in the options, we have 'Allow Farting': ON/OFF. OFF as default. If ON, fart sounds will also be enabled. Also, the farting will only happen if she is stopped (that is, just standing up).
- Rule Change: tail attacks (as a leaf or pure raccoon) wont lock you anymore. If you do the attack, she will do the move, but you can interrupt her just by pressing any key.
- Glitch FIX: the vineblock of 7-1 level (cloud area) was not so easily activated depending on the princess restriction to jumping (like when pregnant), making the player use a leaf to get to the green pipe.
- Glitch FIX: a bit of wrong color tone in the new Peach character (Peachy)
- Glitch FIX: the princess was not 'changing her belly' in certain scenes. Strangely, the belly only 'updated' itself later.
- Glitch FIX: Rosalina without a 'front hand' in certain scenes, like when she falls down (when losing a life)


Update 3.38 (28th June 2017)
- NEW! The so awaited NEW PEACH MODEL from TripFlip! Her name is Peachy and she is the default character from now on. If you want the playshapes or aedler Peach versions, they are (and will) still be available. Just change her character when playing a new game (or use the cheat code to change her character in the OUTFIT screen)! Well, I cant guarantee she is 100% free of glitches for now, but I tested her a lot before releasing her. No Fire Peachy available (and I may not make her until finishing all the worlds and other features first).
- IMPROVED princess character models in the character select screen (they were 'faded' due to some problems vectorizing from GIMP).
- Glitch Fix: the princess was being able to masturbate in hard mode.
- Glitch Fix: In the cataquack scene, a new action/loop where the princess goes up and down, facing us when fucked, was not appearing anymore. Also, her boob nipples were still appearing when se cums.
- Small fixes like a typo in the gallery for Ninjis: the 'ASS STAR ATTACK' can also be vaginal, depending on her state, so the name is now just 'STAR ATTACK'.


Update 3.37 (5th June 2017)
- Rule Change: when saving to Clipboard, you can copy to an external TXT file as before, but now, it wont save ANY SAVED SLOT in the game. It will save to that txt, then you will load it back and the game wont have a new saved slot. If you have 2 saved slots before, it will be still be 2 (untouched). If you dont have any saved game, it will still be empty. Just SAVE the loaded game in a given slot you want.
- Glitch Fix: when the princess are removing her clothes in the level, like when she is a nymph enough to do it (or if you click in her current powerup icon in the top-left of the HUD), if any enemy captures her, she stops removing her clothes all of a sudden to do a lasvicious act. Also, it was making her remove her clothes twice, and the pink message box with 'The princess removed her clothes' werent disappearing in the end.
- Glitch Fix: In the HARD game mode, the LAST scene of any enemy were not being used anymore. As creatures can fuck her in random order, the last one werent being taken in account. More tests needs (mainly for Drybones)
- Glitch Fix: Daisy Vest was being used in her 'back torso'. The effect in the game was two vests when she was crouching facing us with her butt 'upwards' behind her.
- Glitch Fix: when the princess got a swollen asshole, she was not returning it to normal when losing a life or by taking a powerup.
- Glitch Fix: IN HARD GAME MODE, if you are in the Bonus Toad house and you talk with lumas and choice any option, inmediatly you were going out of the level.

Update 3.36 (31th May 2017)
- NEW scene: Jabbi 3 (gangbang)! It's also in the gallery ('Other Enemies' button). If during the scene an 'error in XML' shows up, or the balloons act strangely, please remember to reload an updated XML in my github site or click in RESET SAVES in the loader screen.
- Improved CatSuit powerup model (based on Mario games): a golden bell instead of the icon of a pink catsuit in Peach character.
- Rule Change: If the princess touches a grounded creature that is jumping or falling (e.g. goomba), she will be hurt. Just beware when you walk around areas where creatures might fall from platforms above you.
- Text Fix: Changed 'Doggy AnalStyle' to 'Doggy In Pussy' in Koopa gallery. This never was an anal scene.
- Glitch Fix: a given toad scene in 6-2 level with 'XML ERROR'
- Glitch Fix: Toad scene 8 was being counted as VAGINAL, but its ANAL.
- Glitch Fix: CatSuit powerup not going to the inventory
- Glitch Fix: When using an inventory item in the worldmap, the princess was not updating her outfit correctly (the player needed to move her).
- Glitch Fix: Mushroom dicks scene (like near Mario Pad level), and Bowser scene (during the prison) were not counting as a 'new sex scene', giving the 'still a virgin' glitch.
- Glitch Fix: When a given goomba (e.g. with spikes) appeared from a hole, a different one (e.g. goombario) spawed instead.
- Glitch Fix: wrong 4-4 music in certain places, like a grey pipe (it was playing 'mario underwater music').
- Glitch Fix: Jabbis (the 'flies') where going up until disappearing.
- Glitch Fix: The green blob creature and boos were not appearing in certain levels like 7-6. This occurred at random. (tech info: problem was the Foreground layer with foreign objects)
- Glitch Fix: during the JellyFish sisters scene, the princess got her asshole 'swollen' (but they havent 'fucked' it).
- Glitch Fix: The princess was regaining her garters and stockings (what?) after certain scenes. Tech info:  'frame 0 STOP! instead of 4' (F0SI4 or 'FOSIA') syndrome in those outfit mcs. And the fact those are integers, not "None" String checks anymore in removeHeels() and other functions.

Update 3.35 (21th May 2017)
- Feature: Now you can use one of the sewer pipes to go to a given world you visited at least once with the cannon. If not, the princess will just go outside (Red Pipe).
- RULE CHANGE: in HARD GAME mode, if she has 80% or more (horniness), the princess will be dizzy for a while.
- ADDED a message 'Error in XML' in the INTRO screen, just in case something is wrong with the file you are trying to load up. Sometimes, XML can get corrupted in my github site. You can check if people are updating them without errors by copying all the XML file and pasting in http://www.xmlvalidation.com.
- BUG FIX: when the princess threw a given object, like shells or a pow block in levels like 5-6, she was freezing up!
- Glitch Fix: if 'ALWAYS A NYMPH' Personality option is set, she was still 'shaking herself with her hand in her head' when she stops walking.
- Glitch Fix: when time is up, a creature was appearing all of a sudden during another creature action on the princess. Actually, the creature should only appear if the princess is 'available'.
- Glitch Fix: when you set a custom DRESS Powerup in the OUTFIT screen, then you restart the game, the princess was in her bed with that outfit. Actually, the princess should be with her dress, as she returned from the train like this.

Update 3.34 (17th May 2017)
- NEW: Level 8-2 (underground level). It's a new themed level (it's not a level based on another). Some new textures. There are also interesting features like the rotate platforms and the crushing trunks.
- NEW cheat codes: 'HOLD 1, then left or right' to change outfits, and 'HOLD Y, then press 3' to be pregnant. You need to activate the master cheat first (1 and 0).
- NEW: 'Load Game' and 'Options' buttons in the intro screen!
- ADDED Waluigi in some levels (tip: where he is, Wario might be with him or not), and if you are continuing the game (if you finished it at least once), they will appear all the time in the toad town bar. Waluigi can be in 'Smoothie Depot level too' (with Mona!) She's not a playable character yet. No Waluigi scenes yet.
- Rule change: in skull rocks scene in 6-6 level, if the princess sucks their dicks 'in a non lewd way', it wont count as a sexual act (laid countdown). E.g. If its 48 left to be a pure nymph, it will remain as 48.
- BUG FIX: In 6-4 level, in delfino streets, when using a given green pipe, the game was throwing the princess to a blue void area. Also, the trampoline wasn't working. Finally, the toads were going to the front of a wooden table in certain scenes.
- Glitch Fix: When restarting the game in certain circunstances, odd problems happened with outfits and its current situation, like shred vagina/butt areas. Tech info: 'Flags.SAVED*' not being reset in _reset(), and the new update bodyparts system not using Player.checkShred.
- Glitch Fix: When using the PANIC screen (ENTER key) if in the 'corridor pipe' area (like when using a pipe in the worldmap), the princess was reappearing in the same (or different) worldmap, but zoomed out and with some functions not working. Now she will be warped to 'peach castle campus area' if Panic Screen is used SPECIFICALLY from those specific inner level areas, as there is no way to find out which worldmap she came from (in order to return her to it).
- Glitch Fix: In 6-4 level, XML fix in Pole scene.
- Glitch Fix: When getting pregnant, the princess was disappearing in certain creature scenes (tech info: getPregnantFrom(x) not an array item).
- Glitch Fix: XML ERROR when loading ShyGuy village level in World 3.
- Glitch Fix: In 6-6 level, XML fix in the Flavio dialogue.
- Glitch Fix: The Princess Portrait (horny status) was something showing a wrong princess (e.g. Rosalina) than your current one (e.g. Daisy).
- Glitch Fix: XML fix in Toad (doc or fake doc) scenes: if a normal toad, the princess was saying 'Erhm...Doc...Dont you..Ahhhh... have another way...to cure it?' instead of 'Hey...you're not a doctor! Ahhh!'
- Small enhancements like the 'smoke animation' when changing outfits.

Update 3.33 (10th May 2017) - SERVICE FIXES II
- ADDED Peach Pregnancy screen in the achievement screen! If you playing a 'Peach' character, and you get pregnancy for many times, you will unlock it!
- Rule Change: when the princess is with the slave outfit, she wont lose it part by part. It's a fixed outfit until she finds another powerup or loses a life!
- Rule Change: when the princess buys something that's not a powerup, like the wedding dress from Charlieton, she can wear it right now or let a delivery toad send to her castle closet. You can't put in the inventory anymore. This is due to the fact there is no sense of using wedding dresses, lingerie-only, and other custom outfits only in worldmap. The inventory is used for meaningful powerups like red mushrooms, raccoons, dress powerup and fire flower.
- Improvement: AN OVERHAUL of SAVE/LOAD slot system using 'Multiple Save File Approach - 'MUSAFIA'. Only the first slot is compliant with the last game versions, so you need to resave in slot 2,3,4,5 in order to retain them in your system. You can keep your first saved slot and any saved text (clipboard saved to txt files), as they will work in this version. But beware! The save to clipboard will now save to an external slot (in a text file), then if you load it, it wont recover all your slots (if your game has 0 used slots, it will still be like that). So you just save the loaded game again in a given slot you want.
- Improvement: 'tail' bodypart is now a reference to memory. No more enterframes on it.
- Improvement: when pressing SPACE (next key) in the character select screen, you will get the current selected princess that was made by LEFT/RIGHT keys.
- Readjusted princess size in Monty Mole scenes (she was a bit bigger).
- Glitch Fix: Strange nipples appearing in her backside boobs (when they're large enough when the princess is facing backside) during scenes like SockHop (the green sack creature). Tech Info: 'noNipple' var cant be right in frame 1 of some scenes due to Timeline.exec mechanism + noMoreEnterFrames in objects.
- Glitch Fix: 'Toads in her table' to eat a pizza' scene: scene not happening when all toads are there due to Type Coercion error.
- Glitch Fix: Luigi was not reading his book anymore
- Glitch Fix: The princess was walking like holding a dress, after taking up the 'naked leaf' powerup.
- Glitch Fix: The princess (as a Fire princess) was jumping herself up when hitting a X-naut or a Chomp with a fireball.
- Glitch Fix: When the princess is a raccoon and falling, she only animate her tail once.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was able to 'lose a life' (DEL KEY) in the worldmap.
- Glitch Fix: When using the cannon, the world name was still 'Mushroom Kingdom' in the MENU screen, when reaching a new worldmap, like Bumpy Forest. The player needed to enter a given level, then exit it to return to the current worldmap in order to fix the world name.
- Glitch Fix: The Fire Princess (Frontside dialogue model) was not with red eyes.
- Glitch Fix: Princess' earrings and crown not being removed when she undresses to take a shower. Also, she was leaving the bath stark naked, without her crown (those blue bath she can lay into (marble ones), like in Daisy palace level). Tech Info: 'noPile' returning without executing important functions.
- Glitch Fix: Daisy Palace: Princess' scene with another princess (like Peach and Daisy) showing wrong hands (e.g. Daisy with a wrong Fire Peach hand).
- Glitch Fix: Daisy Palace: Princess' scene with another princess (like Peach and Daisy) making the other princess with the same eye color/style as the main character
- Glitch Fix: Daisy Palace: When Daisy was masturbating, the playable princess' horny bar was going up without the player consent.
- Glitch Fix: Peach Castle level (sewers): strange 'green pipe inside another pipe' in the big upside down pipe in the sewers area of Peach's castle. (Tech info: pipe.init() happens after _level config, so we moved to pos-init).
- Glitch Fix: Peach Castle level (sewers): when the princess used one of the 8 pipes in the bottom, we couldnt use CTRL do go to the menu (strange message: "Can't go to the pause screen while entering doors or objects!")  (Tech Info: wrong 'destination="pipe_out1" which is non existant)
- Glitch Fix: Peach Castle level (sewers): when we pressed LEFT or RIGHT right after the princess returned from the sewer level (a pipe from a given worldmap, like SubCon), the level ends unexpectelly (Tech Info: Fallingpalacemaneuver_4104/frame66()[MarioisMissingPUT_fla.PZz_fallingpalacemaneuver_4104::frame66:4] still being called! Its like when finishing another airship, when returning to the sewers, the airship1 over Peach castle was making her fall that way - message Level 1-1: Config.finishedWorld is true, this happens when Peach beaten the airship some seconds before!). But THIS CAN HAPPEN when Peach returned to worldmap 3, then returned to the sewers much later!)
- Glitch Fix: Princess' Castle level: XML Error when 'talking' with the chains in her tower, and when trying to use the teleporter in 9-1 level
- Glitch Fix: 9-1 level: XML Error when trying to use the teleporter
- Glitch Fix: 4-4 level (Boggly Tree): XML Error when talking to the Puny Elder
- Glitch Fix: In Toad Town, when asking Charlieton to buy something, if you do it, the coins decreases for the HUD, but slowly enough to make Charlieton say 'You dont have enough coins'. Now, you will only be able to press a given number in the dialogue if all coins were removed from the princess 'purse' (her asshole). Also, the 'coin number' animation will be smoother.
- Glitch Fix: XML Error when trying to get 'YourCumWasCleaned' message.
- Glitch Fix: Princess' Castle level: The princess butt is appearing in certain short skirts in the 'side throne' scene (next to her royal table)
- Glitch Fix: The 'Train' occurrence that the princess wrote in her diary is being kept in the diary BEFORE the Toadsworth event.
- Glitch Fix: The princess' eyes (Frontside dialogue model) was not red when the princess is a fire princess.
- Glitch Fix: The female princesses that are friend of Peach (like Daisy and the Shygirl) is with red eyes when you are playing a Fire Peach character.

Update 3.32 (29th April 2017) - SERVICE FIXES
- IMPROVED Princess pose code (no more enterframes). Less CPU usage! (You can notice in DEBUG screen: Zero EP Listeners most of the time!) But tests still being made. Some glitches are expected, like the princess not losing/dressing a crown or part of her clothing until some seconds later or when you change her pose (like walking). If this happens, please create an issue in my GITHUB or just notice me in LOK site.
- Rule Change: The princess wont die from Yux rings in 9-1 level. Thats because this level wasnt made for the princess to lose a life. She is captive, but the level is itself 'secure' enough for her.
- Glitch Fix: 2 strange 'yellow block with eyes' in Peach's castle. Actually they were leftovers of my several tests to fix certain bugs with them.
- Glitch Fix: In 9-1, the princess was not getting invisible after taking the right tube combinations in the concoctionator room.- Glitch Fix: In 9-1, Sir Grodus was not talking when Peach used the TEC cable.
- Glitch Fix: when the princess crushed brown blocks without nothing in it (no coins, etc), there is no animation or sound anymore. They just disappear.
- Glitch Fix: when the princess is invisible, at some animations (like jumping), strange blue hands appear in.
- Frog walk/hopping animation weren't 'going on' (she only do it once), so that we have to push the arrow key again and again (Tech info: gravity when touching the ground interfering with poses (going to 'standing frog' instead of remaining 'walking frog' when LEFT or RIGHT remained pressed. The code was remade).

Update 3.31 (25th April 2017)
- NEW: DoopLiss creature! For now, he will inhabit the ghost castle. But he will only appear in certain days. A tip to see him more often is to detect the pattern of the day. (For example, perhaps he appears in each 4 days). You can talk to him, but no scenes yet!
- NEW: 'Mario?' scene. I wont say what he will really do. The princess can find him in a random level of world 7 and in 8-2. A tip: he usually appears in a forest/grassy area. He's also in the gallery.
- NEW: Peach and Blooper Gangbang art by TripFlip! To unlock it, just fuck all of Bloopers (Squids) unicque scenes.
- Rule Change: MIPS (the rabbit) will appear in more areas of the game. He prefers underground areas.
- Rule Change: in HARD game mode, 50% of 1up mushrooms will be Poison mushrooms instead. It's a random occurrence, so when you punch three 1up blocks in your journey, you may find 1up three times in a row, then poison four times, then 1up just one time, then a poison, etc (it's unpredictable).
- Rule Change: in HARD game mode, pregnancy will happen more often, even if you configure it as 'LOW' in the options. But if you choose NONE, of course she wont get pregnant even in HARD mode.
- Rule Change: in HARD game mode, the princess will be a nymph of the level after 8 scenes instead of 10, and a nymph of the game after 60 scenes instead of 80.
- Added the current game version info in Debug screen (when you press PAGE DOWN key), just to easy my job when people help me find the bugs.
- BUG FIX: WHen the princess used a bomb to explode the rocks (levels like 3-1), she was locking herself up. And sometimes, the rocks werent exploding normally.
- BUG FIX: Creatures freezing when touching the princess when she has a chainball. Instead of fucking her, they stopped working.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was regaining her garters (what?) after certain scenes. 
- Glitch Fix: Adjusted blue 'descent' text (It was too stretched horizontally)
- Glitch Fix: When the princess is in a scene with another female like Chompette or Toadella, she wont say something like 'Wow! What a dick!' and 'Ohhh he doesn't stop cumming!' anymore.
- Glitch Fix: When going to the prologues screen until reaching the train one, both the train music and 'happy mushroom' music were playing at the same time.
- Glitch Fix: Level 9-1 (X-naut base) not playing in the beginning (the player needed to press / button to restart the sound/music)
- Glitch Fix: Certain princess hands were with a wrong color.
- Glitch Fix: The LEVEL names (when you change the translation to another language) remained English. The problem happened because 'variables' file (even in Flags file) loaded BEFORE the XML file was read (I dont know why). So I created a function that returns the current level/world name, going to the current XML. 

Update 3.30 (1st April 2017)
- NEW: Flurry scene 5 (By Blargh!) Its put in scene 4, so scene 5 will be the vaginal one (more time for Peach to remain virgin).
- NEW: Revamped 'underground rock' by Biles! Its those brown rocks in certain levels like 1-3 (underground area).
- RULE CHANGED: 'main cheat' activate key is now '1 and 0' instead of 1,9 and 0 pressed at the same time, due to some requests (people using certain keyboards and notebooks with problems like 3 or more keys pressed at the same time).
- CHANGED: instead of a 'red circle' near to her portrait when there is a bug in the game, the name BUG will appear there instead.
- Glitch Fix: Fire Peach with 'endless growing blue earrings' when taking a Fire Powerup while a normal Peach.

Update 3.29 (3rd March 2017)
- NEW: Fire Peach PS character (due to some requests)!
- NEW: OPTION: "Fire Peach if burned, back to Peach if lost". It will be ON as default. If 'Vanilla Peach' takes a Fire Flower powerup or if she is touched by a fire hazard/creature, she will be with a dark skin. She will be normal again if you take another powerup or lose a life. It will only work if you're using a 'Peach' character. You can disable this feature in the options screen (it will be saved in the cache for new games as well).
- IMPROVED protection modes! Protection is the 'invulnerability time after being hit or a scene'. Now you can choose between 3,2,1 or 0 seconds! Beware that HARD GAME mode ignores this (Its always '0'!) Default: 3 seconds.
- IMPROVED code of Character Select Screen (tech info: target button instead of older 'a listener for each button').
- IMPROVED intro/prologue screens with NEW screens! Now, the first screen tells us that everything was in peace in the princess's castle, then it will show us that the current character (be it Peach, Daisy, Rosalina, etc) was playing with the toads (some in a lewd way), explaining why the innocent princess is already experiencing lascivous actions, then the train scene, and finally the drama of airships invading. Morever, even if you're playing as Daisy or Krystal, for example, the story will tell you were in castle with the toads, etc, as its supposed that each princess know Peach's castle already.
- RULE CHANGED: now, all 4 toads will be seated in her royal table (pizza scene in her castle level) in certain days (Day 5, Day 15...), alongside the current probability to appear in any other day (you can still see them seated there on day 2 and day 8, for example, although much rarer). Before this update, it was hard to get them all seated up (probability < 5%).
- RULE CHANGED: the princess wont be taken by a creature right after using the blue info/sound boxes. Some invulnerability will be applied for enough time to run away.
- RULE CHANGED: When restarting the game, the train and bed scenes in the prologue will now make the princess wear (or not) the garter/stockings/gloves, etc, that was configured in her outfit screen for new powerups.
- BUG FIX: Peach's Bath scenes (like in her castle) are now DISABLED until I fix it.
- BUG FIX: Lakitu pole scene (when the princess touches the dildo) made her disappear. Tech Info: Argument error (this,0)
- Glitch Fix: In the train scenes (like in the prologue and when you walk around in this level with Mario), the mountain were only moving once (then we werent seeing any mountain again). Also, the upper are of the train was blue instead of black (it was like the roof was absent or destroyed).
- Glitch Fix: Certain powerups set with 'random outfit' (like Striker) was making other powerups like Fire Flower also be random.
- Glitch Fix: wrong balloon text in the cumming action of 'curious restrain' scene (next to Leslie the swan) in her castle.

Update 3.28 (26th February 2017)
- NEW: Descriptive tale of 'Princesses Gangbang' scene (as always, English and Portuguese provided. English already in the game. Portuguese in the XML - GITHUB site).
- NEW: Peach Pregnant art by TripFlip! It will appear when the princess gets pregnant. For now, only Peach ART. If you're another princess, only the text will appear.
- ADDED Krystal 'frontside dialogue model' expressions.
- IMPROVED: you can press SKIP KEY (like 'Space') to go to the next gloryhole action in the prison (instead of only relying on the buttons).
- IMPROVED: The xnaut concoction lab table will be a bit transparent, so you can see the fallen tubes.
- IMPROVED slipping/sliding feature (The princess wont do it if in edge of ledges like coinblocks for example).
- IMPROVED Peach head on 'Xnaut achievement art'.
- IMPROVED: When entering doors or warping, she will loop at the correct side (for example, by entering a door facing right, and reappearing in a door that is facing left, she will face left, not the door). But if you keep pressing right when running, for example, she may keep running right, this is normal. I may make this better by making the door in the opposite side (this this would change the level layout).
- BUG FIX: The princess was being able to slide if inside places that goes up or down, like elevators. She was even locking herself up 'forever'.
- BUG FIX: When taking a key (like the golden one in 2-5), sometimes the white door (or other different non related doors) stopped working. This was due to interference with 'checkVeggie' for 'taken' (hidden) items. Now, those hidden items will be 'disabled'.
- BUG FIX: Gloryhole scene (in the prison) stopped working. Remember to update the language XML (or click RESET SAVES) before going to this area, because one of the bugs was inside XML!
- Glitch FIX: the scrap of E. Gadd plans in Peach's body was over his hand.
- Glitch FIX: 'NAN' text in certain castle ending screens.
- Glitch FIX: in Mario Ending 4, right when the princess was bending to his dick, the scene went back to kissing.
- Glitch FIX: a swarm of 'cum sounds' when checking all ending scenes.
- Glitch FIX: When the princess was masturbating while backside facing, she strangely looked at us (frontside mode) while opening her hands, like she is climbing something in the air.
- Some improvements to keys, and little fixes like certain keys with default colors instead of red, grey or other defined colors.

Update 3.27 (10th February 2017)
- NEW! Bowser Castle level (8-7) complete (in regard to structures and rooms)! There is also a toad in a cage (with a dialogue and a scene)! The final scene with Bowser still being made by Blargh.
- NEW: Krystal and Peach PS models in 'Frontside Dialogue' by TripFlip! The Playshapes PS face that was currently in version 3.26, with only one expression, was removed. Krystal expressions still to be made (she has only one expression).
- NEW: Added a descriptive tale for E.gadd Achievement Art by TripFlip (English)! Also translated to Portuguese (my Github site). Finally, I added it correctly if you use the cheats (it was not appearing that way!)
- NEW: The princess can SLIDE DOWN/SLIP along slopes and ladders! Just press DOWN key right next the beginning of the slope or ladder. She can do that when facing the slope or the opposite (a butt slide!) She will pop out/kill any enemy that she touches when sliding. But beware! The princess will also do this if you position her to the edge of two or more blocks in a ledge (right next to pitfalls)! Thats because it will be considered a ladder! The math code is not perfect, the idea is always a faster/optimized code for us to enjoy the feature! So be careful when pressing DOWN key to look down in certain edges!
- BUG FIX: Some levels not loading up (like 6-2) after Toad optimizations.

Update 3.26 (14th January 2017)
- NEW: Bowser Castle level is accessible! Mario is there! Just finish 8-1 first or use the cheat code! 6 rooms so far. Final scene with him and Bowser will come soon!
- NEW: DOZENS of Krystal unicque sounds and improvements to Peach sounds like 'cough' with more varieties. Krystal should now 'only have Krystal sounds'. I need to know (by testing/playing) if Krystal still has 'peach sounds' in certain areas.
- NEW: Krystal 'losing' virginity picture by Scappo.
- BUG FIX: The princess was disappearing when talking to the Blacksmith toad.
- Glitch Fix: the 'sex' counter was not being triggered when peach is pulled up with the fishing rod. The blowjob and the vaginal scene had to be started direct to unlock the gallery.

Update 3.25 (31th December 2016)
- NEW: Earring sizes! You can choose between 'small' and 'big'. Big earrings make the princess APPEAR more lewd (although no effect on her nymphness), like the classic MIM game by Playshapes.
- NEW: Rawk Hawk achivement screen (with the current description tale) by TripFlip! In order to unlock it, you need to be fucked by Rawk Hawk (and he needs to ejaculate!) This happens if he doesnt put you upside-down. So just interact with him again until getting fucked.
- NEW: Added 'audience' sounds. Some will happen in Rawk Hawk achievement and in some 'audience'/group toad scenes.
- RULE CHANGED: now you can have up to 9999 coins! Suggestion by Silverdragon. I noticed many people get 999 coins in a few hours of play, so let's have more!
- The 'big princess model' during dialogues will now have 'wearable earrings' (if the playable character is not using them, it wont appear in the big model).
- Added 'Fire Peach', 'Tanned Peach' and 'Peach PS' (experimental) to the big princess model in dialogues. Peach PS eyes and mouth doesnt change yet.
- ADDED a button over treasury chests in Bonus Toad House level (those 'press UP to interact' messages).
- ADDED a new config option: TIMEOUT! You can choose either 50,100,200,300,400,500 or 600. 
- RULE CHANGE: The princess will get a penalty after X seconds of the timeout above (instead of only once in a level). So if you configure as 100 seconds, she will get into a scene when its 100, 200, 300, and so on.
- CHANGED: Princess eyebrows are prominent (over her bangs), and they are now blackier, and PS Peach has 'side black brows' to preserve Mario is Missing feeling since 2010. A good reason is this picture (post http://legendofkrystal.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=2265&p=589266#p589266)
- CHANGED: Now the game is faster as its now recommended to be played on Flash Player 12! Flash Player 20 HAS PROBLEMS with the game. You can use other versions, but if you get the 'Princess Disappearing when stomping an enemy', you need to try another Flash version! You can find Flash Player 12 here http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/updaters/12/flashplayer_12_sa.exe. If the link is broken, just search for 'flashplayer_12_sa.exe' (or 'flashplayer_12_sa_debug.exe') in the WEB. But be careful when downloading from untrusted sites! More in 'BUG FIX' below.
- BUG FIX: Peach was appearing 'through the wall' when using two pipes in 7-4 level.
- BUG FIX: Princess locking up in pipes when masturbating on them.
- BUG FIX: Jinx scene 3 locking the princess up (tech info: tipMessage() function throwing an error instead of just saying a XML entry doest not exist! Now it will still keep working even with no text, and XML is now Fixed!)
- BUG FIX: Toad Town: not selecting 'option 4' (Lingerie Pack or Wedding Dress) with Charlieton (in case your use a translated XML), making the princess lock up.
- BUG FIX: A VERY ANNOYING ONE when you used FLASH PLAYER 20 to play the game. If you jumped on a creature like Goomba, the princess disappeared! This problem DOESNT HAPPEN in other versions of Flash. Analysing the problem during long debug sessions, I noticed Flash Player 20 BREAKS the game! Now the game will detect if you are using a buggy version of the player and it will alert you to download others!
- Glitch Fix: Bowser scenes not getting unlocked in the gallery when you get some variables that get it unlocked (like when finishing the game).
- Glitch Fix: Cloud platforms of levels like 7-4 werent working! Tech Info: the new 'square code' (which is a now a sprite, using less memory/CPU) needed a 'Point' variable)
- Glitch Fix: Wario strangely changing clothes during the 'take coins' scene, like in the bathroom of a level.
- Glitch Fix: The unlocking gallery message of Thwomp, Bobombs or Piranha Plant appears after every additional scene with one of those (even if already unlocked).
- Glitch Fix: During vine scenes, when it ends, its hard to fly away before getting catched up again.
- Glitch Fix: Boss endings was getting unlocked earlier wrongly. Remember that in order to unlock them all, you need to be laid by all Koopalings (full sex scenes), THEN other half bosses like Rawk Hawk and Lady Bow (all of their scenes).
- Glitch Fix: music not changing inside certain areas, like underwater of 1-4.
- Glitch Fix: In the pregnancy screen, the 'Days To Deliver' was not showing the number of days left. Tech info: Util.tx() affecting only one parameter instead of more Dlg.txt items.
- Glitch Fix: ballons of text in the checkpoing flag (not checkpoint bath) with untidy and bugged text
- Glitch Fix: Blueprint in a given level was not shown in the level loader screen.
- Glitch Fix: Cyrilic characters not working in 'text balloons' of shower baths.
- Glitch Fix: Toad achievement art not getting unlocked. Now the player also need less of them (there are more than 25, so a bit more than 50% of them will unlock it. I wont say the exact number of those unicque scenes).
- Glitch Fix: Default belly was '4' instead of '5'. This causes the false impression her max belly is smaller than thought, making the player have to check Belly Min/Max in the options just to check there is a Biggest option. Now 'Biggest' as 'MAX' is the default (5).
- Glitch Fix: Mushroom Frogs not interactable. You need to update the XML (GITHUB link) to fix it.
- Glitch Fix: Inventory was not removing the item if you select the one in the left of another one that's already on it. It was only deleting from the 'rightmost' one.
- Glitch Fix: Luma scene 2 without empty text balloons.
- Glitch Fix: Rawk Hawk scene with empty text balloons.
- Glitch Fix: Text balloons not being clickable in 'waterfall shower' in 4-4. Also, 'removed clothes' message on it (it should not happen).
- Glitch Fix: Text balloons being duplicated in rare circunstances, like if you zoom in during a scene with a balloon, or when you get captured by a creature while touching the limit of the room (walls).

Update 3.24 (24th December 2016)
- NEW: Krystal Portrait (teen model) by Myuu! This was a so expected revamp since 2015. Default will be hers. If people prefer the old thinner model, just go to the OPTIONS menu and set 'Teen Krystal Portrait' as NO.
- NEW: Peach can go to the greenish bubble bath in 7-7 level (Nimbus land), but she wont do it if she is embarrassed.
- NEW: In the cake scene (in her kitchen), you can select an option in the dialogue: 'A toad is coming!', to make a toad appear there and see what she is doing (new scene). You can also select another option: 'Two toads will take the cake!', which will bring the cake to the royal table or the toad bedrooms!
- NEW: 'Big Dialogue Peach model' wont have a crown or earring anymore if the main character havent them.
- IMPROVEMENT to random texts! Now, instead of a high probability of two texts being the same in scenes where she is already a nymph, or when seen again, like in DO-OVERS (provided 'Same Dialogues' is NO in the options), they will be a new one, until all different possibilities in the XML is used! Just like SHUFFLE function in a music playlist.
- IMPROVEMENT (XML): Now you can add/remove "look", "generalScene", "generalSceneSlut", "climax", "climaxSlut" and "boob" of the scene "dialoguePrincess" in the XML. Those are used in her balloon text during identical scenes (those ones that's the same one you're into before. So if you are creative and put, say, 500 "climax" entries, the random function will work well with all of those during scenes.
- OPTIMIZATION to the text balloon system (less memory usage, more clean code). The last time it got improvement (foreground balloon system) was in Update 2.2.6 (11th September 2014).
- Adjusted Chuck (Football Players) walking/running speed. It will be a tad faster, and up to 2x faster 25% of the time (or all the time in a hard game mode)
- BUG FIX: Bowser bonus scene not loading up
- BUG FIX: Level 9-1: Very ANNOYING Sir Grodus making the princess disappear when she catches her (during his scene). The cause: timeouts making state="walk", even clearing those timeouts before. I added a check that only makes it happen if state is "stopped".
- BUG FIX: Level 9-1: Another ANNOYING 'Locker sound' after Peach gets her rest, just before asking TEC-XXX about the disk. TECH INFO: an 'obj' is making 'locker clothes' MC play (like obj.play or gotoAndPlay) in other dialogue engine than 'messageBoxLab1'. Its hard to explain but anyway, I removed the listener of addEnterFrameKeyPressed().
- BUG FIX: Peach locking up if you remove her clothes entirely (like clicking in the HUD), then going to certain baths like in her castle (she will try to remove her clothes again).
- Glitch Fix: When peach is bending (backside view) like when she is horny or a nymph while stopped in a level, her sounds wont be playing all the time (even if in the Pause and Options screen).
- Glitch Fix: XML not translating correctly when the princess is saying what she wants in a scene ('random phrases according to her nymphness).
- Glitch Fix: some buttons in the gallery not working (like Pokey - scene 'Bead Stuck Fuck').
- Glitch Fix: in 'Toad Audience scene', an horny toad were masturbating in front of the princess' back, avoiding us to...erhm...see it better. Actually that toad should not be there during this scene.
- Glitch Fix: Sir Grodus with wrong words (sometimes with strange characters like '<f i="1">'). Also when he captures her. You have to reload a language (XML) from the GITHUB link, or click RESET SAVES, or you might see empty dialogues.
- Glitch Fix: Mario was not responsive in her castle (after the game is finished at least once). We pressed UP key near him, but no effect.
- Some glitches fixed like Russian characters not yet centered up.

Update 3.23 (11th December 2016)
- NEW Scene: Curious Chain. You can see it in the tower of her castle (Peach Castle level). Just climb the 'long ladder' in the right of the kitchen area. You can interact with the restrains/chains.
- NEW Achievement art: Peach and Birdo by TripFlip! Just get fucked by all Birdo scenes to get it. No descripton text (tale) yet.
- NEW: Part II of Level 8-1 (this level is now complete!) For now, Mario will be awaiting you in the end of this level, so you wont be returning to worldmap (because this world has only that level so far).
- NEW enemy: Bullet Bill. Its in level 8-1. No scenes yet. If the princess touches it, she will be harmed and a piece of outfit will be shred. She can stomp them though.
- NEW pose during bath: If the princess takes a shower and you press 'Ass Back' button, and she is horny or already a nymph, there is a 50% chance for her to bend and clean her pussy, facing her butt directly to us.
- NEW action: 'Looking at the toilet'. Just press '2) Look at it' after pressing UP or clicking the button on any useable toilet. Also, you can press SKIP KEY (like SPACE) to exit, instead of number 8.
- NEW: 'Console mode'. You can access the console in order to see ERRORS that might be bugging the game. If you are playing the game, and suddenly a RED CIRCLE appears in the TOP RIGHT of the screen appears in, something unexpectedly happened. But beware. Many 'TypeError: Error #1009' and '#1034' errors are false positives. However, if you notice the red button and something got wrong with the game (e.g the princess disappeared) you can go to it, then SELECT the text with the mouse and then CTRL+C, posting in the 'Peach Untold Tale' thread of Legend of Krystal or Aedler site, so I can fix it faster. This red button will reset in each level, because the game cleans up all the errors (each level is a new engine start) so you should store it somewhere else before ending the level. You need to be playing the Flash DEBUG version to get the full error messages. Normal games will only throw generic errors without further descriptions.
- Added Peach singing sound when she uses the showers.
- Added 5 more Ninji creatures along world 3 levels and there will be ninjis along world 8, as there were only 1 or 2 in the whole game before!
- Now, the princess can have her cum cleaned if she passes UNDER waterfalls.
- OPTIMIZATION: externalized SquareCode and change from MovieClip to Sprite (more game speed).
- OPTIMIZATION: "Entering into pipe, tree and hole Engine" mechanism (EN-EN). 
- BUG FIX: LONG LASTING ONE since 2.3.13 (lockPrincessWhenWarpingToSquareCodeAutoSpawnCreature, lovely called 'LoPriWhenWarpsCoSpa' bug): In the beginning, I was thinking X-naut was freezing up the whole game when the princess reached the white elevator in 9-1 (tech info: 'xnaut11' 'square code' enemy touching the 'view' area of that elevator, also touching 2 'blue dialogue areas'.) I had to investigate and I noticed finally that the problem wasnt with the xnauts nearby, but the way she was set as 'INVISIBLE' when warped. One thing is her 'invisible CHARACTER'. Another thing is her 'invisible OBJECT' being set wrongly.
- Glitch Fix: 'Hentai Art' link in the Credits wasnt working anymore.
- Glitch Fix: The fire-traps in 1-6 and 2-4 still seem to be at the wrong place
- Glitch Fix: E-gadd not talking in some dialogues (empty text) and double Peach when he grabs her out of the room.
- Glitch Fix: The timer was getting 'speeded up' like 2x each level.
- Glitch Fix: Lakitu blowjob scene with two 'pink' balloon dialogues instead of just one.
- Glitch Fix: 'I...I really need to remove this outfit' message appearing even if she is already naked.
- Glitch Fix: Score Points not getting updated in the HUD.
- Glitch Fix: "Zess,true T" text showing when talking to the female grumpy toad.
- Glitch Fix: In 9-1, when the princess took the cocktail (potion from the concotionator), the game doesnt let us press space/next key. And if she tried to press the concotionator button, she was locking herself up (no space was working either)
- Glitch Fix: Some outfits like apron and catsuit, after picking them up, was making the princess wear the slavesuit instead of the correct one.
- Glitch Fix: In 7-5, when the princess enters in one of the champion rooms and she masturbates on one of the beds, she is not able to leave the room or interact with anything else.
- Glitch Fix: Bath Dialogue Text (like 'Ass Back, Clean, Exit..') was not being translated correctly.
- Glitch Fix: End Level stats screen not updating text like Orgasms to the language set in the XML.
- Other minor fixes and increase of balloon dialogues in 'Stand (microphone) scene' in her castle.
- Yet more improvements to the game language (XML).


Update 3.22 (16th November 2016)
- NEW: Part I of Level 8-1 is now accessible (Tank Wank Brigade I). New tank vehicles!
- NEW: 'Random' powerup setting mode. If you go to her Outfit Room and click twice in each powerup icon, it will be set at RANDOM mode. Clicking on it again will set the current chosen outfit!
- NEW: Achievement Art from TripFlip (Gangbang between Peach, Daisy, Rosalina and Wendy)! But it will appear only if you are playing as Peach (Normal, PS Peach, Tanned Peach or Fire Peach) and she gets fucked by all of those (for Daisy, you need 4 or more scenes with her), so the achievement art will be unlocked after those are met. For now, Rosalina is not in the game as a friend, so you just need to fuck Daisy and Wendy. 
- NEW: If the horny bar is near max or if you click in the current powerup in the HUD, a dialogue to remove powerup/outfit will be shown. If you confirm, the princess will remove her clothes slowly (instead of being naked immediatelly), except if she is using a 'mutant' powerup like racoon or yoshi (a 'pouf' cloud animation will happen instead). The princess needs to be standing (not moving, flying or swimming) and not engaged in a scene.
- Added 'MEDIUM' pregnancy chance (20%) in the options.
- Now, a coin sound will also be heard if an achievement is unlocked.
- Now, If a given level has a blueprint, its icon will appear before entering a level (in the changing level screen).
- Improvement to default game language (English). The changes are also in the XML (github link). HUGE thanks for *larsrand* and all the others who helped!
- Glitch FIX: 'Heart' icon not appearing in many dialogues (tech info: \u2665 or \\u2665 doesnt work in XMLs. We just paste the heart icon directly).
- Glitch FIX: the princess was being able to jump while chained, and when pressing the opposite direction, she was trying to walk in the same direction until finally changing direction.
- Glitch FIX: bath area in level 4-4 (bubbles) not working
- Glitch FIX: the princess was not hopping like a frog anymore (if Frog powerup was on), and Frog princess was drifting down instead of staying steady (in same height).
- Glitch FIX: the princess (while a frog) was 'sliding' with a locked up pose (like 'standing up') if she takes the Frog Powerup while underwater and touching the ground with her feet.
- Glitch FIX: her pants was shred in her pussy area in her big model (forward dialogue model). This problem happened in 6 outfits.
- Glitch FIX: 'Blueprint cheating' not working
- Glitch FIX: Strange 'Left over' objects and sounds after the 'changing level' screen, like wrenches still being thrown by wrench guys from the 'airship level portraits', but being active in the real airship level.
- Glitch FIX: When clicking in the powerup icon in the hud to remove clothes, if you went to Pause screen (by pressing CTRL), then returned, you couldn't select any number (the dialogue locked up).
- Some small fixes

Update 3.21 (22th October 2016) 
- NEW: Now you can click in 'LIVES number' of the princess (next to her horny bar in the HUD) to make her lose a life in case you cant press DEL key (if you're using a MAC for example).
- NEW: In the options screen, 'EXTRAS' header, now you can configure scene loops (During Scenes...) for 3x, 4x and 5x, instead of 'no loop' and 2x.
- NEW: Xnaut achievement art by TripFlip!
- NEW: Charlieton scene 2 by Blargh! To see it, just talk to him and select '3) Steal coins from him!', then talk to him again and select it once again!
- NEW: **HUGE** Internationalization (i18n) in the game! But warning! If you change the language during the game, the game WILL RESTART (so it will apply the changes). You can change/translate ALL scenes and screens. Its almost 300 scenes and more than 20 screens, so PLENTY of text, including all Koopalings! But remember, the INTRO (LOADER) screen, SCENE NAMES in the gallery (like 'Deep Throat' for goomba), and CREATURE NAMES not into XML yet. If you notice a given text was not mapped into XML (e.g. a given screen or scene), please tell me which text its appearing in which screen or scene in the game. UTF-8 partially working, but only for Latin and Russian. Accents work! I dont have plans (so far) to make it japanese, chinese, indian or other non-latin language. In order to apply your XML, you have to download the XML as a template in my GITHUB link in the first thread of my post in LOK or Aedler site, then you can work on it and make pull requests, calling it another name, like XMLLanguage_african.xml, to maintain the convention. Then you go to the game (main screen, where NEW GAME is), then click in the pinky bottom button: 'Change Language'). It will open a popup where you will select the XML from a folder. Then the game will restart with the changes. It must have no syntax errors, or the game will return to the last working loaded XML. You can also change the language in the OPTIONS screen (in 'TEXT and INFO' header).
- NEW: The princess will now get into a scene IN FRONT of other enemies (so she will be in our view). Laid enemies will be piled up in the background. If one of them awakes (like when we press DO OVER key), they will be IN THE FRONT again.
- NEW: If the princess is in the background (when using the swivel fence, like in level 7-6), firewheels WONT hurt her.
- ADDED a text informing the player if DEL key doesnt work, like if the princess is using a pipe or in a level she can lose a life, avoiding - or trying to avoid - entire game crashes).
- ADDED a soundbox and a message informing us about the swivel fence in 7-6. The princess needs to climb it in order to get to other areas of the level.
- CHANGED: Krystal's boobs are now fuzzier.
- CHANGED: Krystal will now 'catwalk' if she takes some cherries (gallop as a cat). This feature was asked by some players.
- CHANGED: Now you can press SPACE (or other skip key that was set) instead of '5' to leave Mario dialogue.
- CHANGED: Toad dialogues changed to 'Princess Perspective'. He will now say his phrase, then you press NEXT KEY ('SPACE' in keyboard type 1) and the princess will say "Give him some relief? 1) With my hands, etc...." instead of "1) Allure her to play with your dick, 2) Make her suck you, etc"
- CHANGED: Now you can add or remove tips (inside XMLs, tags named <text name="tip">) in case you want more of them (or not).
- ENGINE CHANGE: 'Respawn Layer' now used sparingly. Objects are now smarter and they're put in the same 'Level' layer. Less objects in Respawn Layer means more game speed in large levels! Used DisplayObject Child Layering techniques.
- BUG FIX: Some XML and screen problems. 
- BUG FIX: Boobs arent being changed in the options menu.
- Glitch Fix: Birdo with wrong color (pink) her scene 2.
- Glitch Fix: a bit of 'meat' showing up above front breast of SIDE pose of Catsuit (like standing and walking).
- Glitch Fix: 'Normal' and 'Whore' endings WERENT unlocking their gallery areas!
- Glitch Fix: Mario was 'strange' (not respecting the shadow in the princess bedroom when dark) and Mario was in front of her (in a way the princess walked through him) when replaying the game with KEEP PLAYING button (after saving Mario).
- Glitch Fix: added a new row of achievements (due to limit of 24 reached, but we have more than 26 total achievements)
- Glitch Fix: Sky or ceiling being blue in certain areas (even in inner rooms) that must be solid black instead of blue.
- Glitch Fix: If we go into the load screen from the outfit/showroom screen and then press the BACK button, all the changes actually get applied.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was 'walking over Mario' in Worldmap8. Moved Mario to another area and changed his layering.
- Glitch Fix: When changing her belly in a way the BELLY MAX was smaller than her current belly, or BELLY MIN being bigger in the options, her belly wasnt changing.
- Glitch Fix: When the princess was a nymph, she was starting levels talking with hidden 'mushroom dicks', like in Toad Town.

Update 3.20 (7th September 2016)
- NEW: Roy Boss (Koopaling) scene made by Blargh! Already in the gallery!
- NEW: The princess will be in a lewd pose if she is a nymph while resting (idle). Pose made by Biles.
- NEW: 'Big green blob' creature from Super Mario World. He moves from right to left. You need to avoid it. If it touches you, it's expected to have a scene where she will be inside him and the 'peristaltic' walls will make her cum. For now, no scenes yet. He will just harm you. You can see them in Ghost Castle (world 3) and in the Grey Castle of World 7 (level 7-6).
- ADDED "The gallery scenes for his creature was been UNLOCKED!" message if you got all of this creature scenes.
- Improvement/revamp of 'grey brick' textures (like in 1-6, 2-4 and 7-6 levels). Thank you Biles for the new textures!
- Revamp of 'Mario Keeps' (those brown castles in the beginning/end of certain levels) by Biles! Adjusted heights and placement in all levels that have them.
- Added 'Controls-QWERTY' text (also for the other modes) in the pause screen, in order to alert the player of the current chosen keyboard region.
- Rule change: the princess wont masturbate automatically if she is a nymph anymore, as this can be annoying sometimes. If you want her to be masturbating more, just do it (press masturbation key by yourself).
- Rule change: the princess will be able to stomp 'uncle goombas', goombario and other goomba races (except the gritty goombas and those with the spike helmets). If I make a  friendly goomba IMPORTANT in a given level in the future (so the princess cant stomp him), then a message will inform she cant stomp that special goomba. Also, in this case, that goomba WONT fuck her automatically if she is horny or a nymph.
- BUG FIX: if you keep walking right or left in the worldmap while restrained (chained), then release the button, players were hearing 'tump' sounds (like she was still walking), then she stops and we couldnt move her anymore (tech info: canMove being FALSE inadvertedly).
- BUG FIX: if you keep walking or running right or left, then enter in a trunk door (like by pressing UP or clicking in the button) in levels like 4-1 and 4-2, the princess was locked in the same pose (e.g. walking all the time) without entering the door (tech info: old code in trunkBackWarp, like usage of interactiveButtonPressed directly).
- BUG FIX: after certain gameovers, in a Bowser scene, a weird blue and black screen appeared and the player could not move the princess anymore.
- Glitch Fix: Toadsworth scene 2 (sucking then making him sleep) wasnt working with A button (DO OVER). It was crashing the game or making the princess disappear (MORE TESTS NEEDED)
- Glitch Fix: The boss bass (red giant fish) was not 'floating' anymore (since the AS3 conversion). He was just 'flowing left or right', without any buyoancy.
- Glitch Fix: cant jump over the ledge in the mushroom platform of Level 5-3 (ledge too far away).
- Glitch Fix: Attack key in 'single left hand' type, with QWERTY region wasnt right (the correct is the 'Y' key). Also, 'Q and D' is wrong. The correct is 'A and D'.
- Glitch Fix: the princess was being stuck (and losing a life) after reaching the yellow pipe on 5-5.
- Glitch Fix: double princess after the usage of the finish pole (when pressing item 4 - EXIT).
- Glitch Fix: Boos werent 'stunned' for enough time after each scene, making the princess fail to run away on time.
- Glitch Fix: The 'yellow block with eyes' that grows a beanstalk, once hit, enable the princess to climb it, but the beanstalk was making her fall when its fully emerged. The problem is that the beanstalk MUST be 'climbable' ONLY when it STOPS growing from the block.
- Glitch Fix: Certain levels like the worldmap had skies 'in the dark' (black without stars).
- Glitch Fix: The princess was with a falling pose, but not really falling if she was taken in a sex scene while climbing a vine or ladder (like when Lakitu, the toad in the cloud, got her). The problem is that she was taken while climbing, so in the end of the scene, the computer thought she was still climbing, locking herself there.
- Glitch Fix: Missing the portrait of levels 'Airship 4' and 'Airship 7' (before the level starts)
- Some small corrections, like the removal of 'walking over screws' in airship 4. Now the princess needs to use the rotation platforms. Also, added mountains in the intro screen (main game menu).

Update 3.19 (30th August 2016)
- Added more areas in the seventh palace level (nimbus land).
- Rule Change: now the toad sack will only be shred if the princess has beaten the Birdo (Dragon) in the grey castles.
- Rule Change: now the Leaf powerup will disappear if it falls a lot.
- BUG FIX: Finally FIXED the 'gravity bounce' bug that was happening with some creatures and objects. When the princess jumped (or any movement that made the camera go up or down), those were trespassing the ground and sometimes bouncing up or just falling down from platforms. Used the 'MaCaOL' strategy (Main game loop calling other loops)!
- BUG FIX: Duplicates of Toad Doctor when the princess entered the nurse area (tech info: squareCodesInLevel with leftovers, so deleting one was not deleting others, making swapChildren fail with a null obj.newName).
- BUG FIX (a very long lasting bug due to difficulties to reproduce): Lakitu scene freezing the princess (while making her invisible). Thank you BlackLynx for the steps to reproduce it! The cause was a 'index out of bounds' because a former scene number was bigger than 2 (say, goomba scene 3 or shyguy scene 4). This was being used as lakitu scene counter, but lakitu only has 2 scenes in the cloud. The cure was to update 'PlayScene' with the current Lakitu PlayScene.
- BUG FIX: With the option "Toads able to fuck her" as YES, some levels was making her fuck the toads right on entering them, in a way the game glitched, like in 1-3 and 1-6 (grey castle).
- Glitch Fix: strange 'white covering' in the level when the princess was wearing Shadow Queen in a dialogue scene.
- Glitch Fix: The HUD was showing 'Lives: 10' for a second, as well as some other stats before returning to normal.
- Glitch Fix: The bumpties (friendly creatures) was not being stomped. Instead, they were talking to the princess while she was returning from jump.
- Glitch Fix: the possibility to go to PAUSE SCREEN while going into doors/vases or other objects was locking the princess forever.
- Glitch Fix: Bobomb explosion achievement showing '"Achievement Unlocked!:null" (Tech info: BobOmb)
- Glitch Fix: 'a loosen wall' in the bonus 'sand' area in 3-2 that was making the princess fall if she walked left or right.
- Glitch Fix: invisible pots (pink mushroom-like block) appearing after throwing the same one many times, like in level 3-2.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was being 'locked while standing up pose' if you kept pressing left or right just after grabbing a veggie/object.
- Glitch Fix: Luigi sometimes was saying 'null' when reading his book.
- Glitch Fix: The bath buttons (like in Daisy Palace - 2-7) weren't working
- Glitch Fix: When clicking QWERTY button (to change it), the keyboard screen was exiting with an unpredicted state.
- Glitch Fix: The bonus pipe areas of 2-1 and 2-2 was not being enterable
- Glitch Fix: The princess not being able to stomp the snake inside certain vases.

Update 3.18 (15th August 2016)
- NEW: Worldmap 8! To reach it, just beat the Koopaling of World 7 and activate the bunker. You can wander around there, but no levels yet. There are also new objects: the 'golden lockers' (like SMB3). In order to trespass them, you will need to unlock then by going into certain levels and leave them with a given key in the future. That miniature palace there will be Bowser Castle (I am still making the new miniature). First level will be Bowser Castle, so people can play inside it and see Mario locked in a cell. For now, Mario is outside, so you can end the game normally.
- NEW: Level 7-7 (Airship). Roy is there, but as a placeholder. Just talk to Mario to end the game (World 8 to be made soon).
- NEW: Palace (Nimbus Land) level, before the 7-7 airship. New music too (based on SMRPG)
- NEW: Lady Bow scene 3. For that to happen, you need to revisit the levels she are in, like the Ghost House. All three scenes are now in the gallery (Bosses button).
- NEW: Diary Entry for when the princess gets pregnant.
- NEW: 'Full Screen' buttons in the loader screen and in the options screen ('ENGINE' header). Also, 'Force 16:9 maximized' for those who use a browser like chrome, but want to go 'full screen' (which is actually a maximized mode).
- EXPERIMENTAL: Now if you go to the panic screen due to a scene locking the princess up (or making her invisible), she MAY appear again (force mode). Not tested in all scenes, so some creatures might break (like certain piranha plants).
- Improved 'tolkien stools/chairs' in Peach's Castle table.
- Improved 'toad audience' animation (some areas like her royal table are making some toads 'walk in the air' when grouping up).
- Rule Change: the koopalings that can walk (like Morton, Iggy and now Lemmy) will turn to where the princess is when returning moving.
- Rule Change: her toilet wont have cum on its walls anymore, as its her 'safe clean' bathroom, in contrast to public ones.
- ADDED 'Click to change' in the blue 'QWERTY button' in the keyboard screen to avoid people to miss the fact its a button which can change to QWERTZ and AZERTY (feature since Update 1.8.15).
- CHANGED: 'Can Be Pregnant' option is now called 'Pregnancy Chance'. It can be None, Low and High.
- CHANGED: The music when reaching the palace of each world will be now the 'peril song' until the princess beats the airship.
- CHANGED: You cant have more than one scene with Lady Bow in a level. She will vanish after a given scene, so to see more scenes, you need to find her somewhere else or revisit the level. To unlock Lady Bow in the 'Bosses' gallery, you have to be with her in all scenes, not only the first.
- CHANGED: The computer in the bunker will now say the current world in a white text info ('Changing target to World'...)
- BUG FIX: Peach's Castle level broken ('going to the roof' effect) after saving Mario (ending 4 -> Keep Playing)
- Glitch Fix: The princess was appearing in Peach's Castle as a 'naked leaf' after the endings are played and 'Keep Playing' was clicked.
- Glitch Fix: strange 'Birdo spitting pearl' sound in certain World 3 levels (right in the beginning).
- Glitch Fix: 'title buttons' not selectable by keyboard if you wait until the title 'Peach Untold Tale' comes down.
- Glitch Fix: 'moving clouds' not working, like in airship levels.
- Glitch Fix: 'Game Over music' not playing.
- Glitch Fix: some oddities in 3-4 level (pipe with wrong color, second door not working, no music, generic Toad).
- Glitch Fix: the princess was able to 'run' while drunk/dizzy.
- Glitch Fix: the checkpoints (shower checkpoint too) were being activated right in the beginning of levels like 1-1 and 1-3.
- Glitch Fix: the princess was 'being blocked while jumping' like 'hitting an invisible block' when her tail or a veggie touched a block nearby.
- Glitch Fix: when hitting a block with a tail, the princess was without the tail, and glitching herself, like not walking anymore.
- Glitch Fix: when flying (as a pure raccoon/tail only), if you make her fall a bit, she werent going up again when pressing JUMP key (she was always in the same height).
- Glitch Fix: A day was being counted more than one in the train prologue area, making the princess appear in her castle on the day 2. The 'train day' should be counted as 0.
- Glitch Fix: if the princess was using a dress before going to the cannon in the worldmap 1, when inside it, her skirt was strangely sticked in the same place (not being moved with the cannon).
- Glitch Fix: when Peach PS 'looked down' or in certain aims, her eyesballs were 'trespassing' her eye area.
- Glitch Fix: her model in the outfit room screen was clickable (mouse icon) but nothing happened (it should not be clickable anymore).

Update 3.17 (2nd August 2016)
- Added a new diary entry! The princess will write about her fellings of losing her virginity to Mario, before she wakes up in her castle (right in the beginning of the game).
- Added keyboard support to the main screen. You can press UP or DOWN to select the menu item, like 'Normal Game' or 'Gallery', then press SPACE (or E or Another Key if you saved a previous game with another keyboard config).
- Added keyboard support to the character select screen. You can press RIGHT or LEFT to change the princess.
- Added two buttons in the 'princess showroom' in the outfit screen (easier to go back to previous poses instead of clicking many times on the princess to see a missed one).
- Added 'Boeing' and 'Pop' sounds when changing the princess boobs in the outfit room and in the gallery.
- Added a 'prank' in the Achievement screen.
- Pregnancy with goombas now possible. For now, a child will be born and then he will run away from her.
- DISABLED Blit in Background. It was giving many glitches. To be researched a better function in the future.
- Rule change: toadette wont say the same beginning phrase if you talk to her anymore. She may repeat some phrases, though.
- Rule change: the princess wont be able to use the pipe in her bathroom if its the first day she is in her castle. This is to make all of us use the normal exit (the star door), and this avoids many bugs, because that alternate exit right in the first day will skip her dialogue with Toadsworth, toadette, and the fact Toadsworth might be still trying to greet her in the stairs (the princess would try to say 'I feel someone is waiting...', even without him there anymore).
- Rule change: the princess' ass will be 'gaped' only if she uses a dildo or she is fucked in the ass three or more times. Creatures like Chain Chomp, Blooper, Shyguys, Pokeys and Goombas wont make a gape right in the first anal. Koopalings, Thwomps and HUGE objects still make a gape in the first penetration because their dicks are huge.
- Better stretching mode when enlarging the game window (in case you use standalone Flash Player, Irfanview, etc). No more 'letterbox' effect with artifacts and areas you should not see. But please use CTRL+F (or a menu item: FULL SCREEN) to go to full screen mode. Just clicking twice with the mouse to maximize might cut out some sides because when maximizing, the game (made for 4:3 screens) wont scale well with widescreen (only a pure FULL SCREEN mode corrects this).
- BUG FIX: 4 'train' bugs found by Tiger_Eli.
- BUG FIX: The princess was not warping correctly from the red pipe in the worldmap to the 'inner pipe' area (tech info: 'point' globalLocal not working anymore, I wonder why)
- Glitch Fix: Starman music not stopping when it ends (another music overlaps it). Tech info: listener not stopping imediatelly with channel.stop() after mus2 replaced mus1.
- Glitch Fix: After getting fucked by Mips the rabbit, if the princess try to interact with him while asleep, she might get locked up with no scene. Actually the interact button should not appear anymore, as he is sleeping.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was losing her crown and earrings after taking a bath, like the one in her castle.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was able to climb more than expected (like trespassing a ladder top).
- Glitch Fix: 'Princess Model' during dialogues not disappearing when the princess left a toilet event.
- Glitch Fix: Certain buttons appearing 'in the top screen', like when the princess jumps over Mario in the train.
- Glitch Fix: The cum on Peach's bed will only happen after the Toads jerk on it.
- Some aesthetic fixes (cosmetic) like bigger toilet holes and a 'green lit' Egadd door (it was red before).

Update 3.16 (23th July 2016)  - WARNING, older saved games may not work correctly!
- NEW: "Flippable fences", like in Super Mario World. Its in level 7-6.
- NEW: Level 7-6. But still in progress. 
- NEW: You can now press '0' when next to a laid creature to change its scene consecutivelly (so, instead of pressing 1,2,3 or 4 in order to see if that action is available for that laid creature, you can just keep pressing '0' to navigate through all possible scenes quickier, then press DO OVER button). This is useful for those creatures with more than 10 scenes (like Goombas and Koopas). Not all creatures have that feature.
- NEW: Princess Frontside Model during Dialogues! So far, Peach, Daisy and Rosalina. She wont change color/style if Burn Peach , Peach PS or Tanned Peach is chosen. To see her, just talk with some creatures or when she is surprised with something (like if Toadsworth is near). If the princess is with big boobs or belly, the model wont have those updated due to limitations. Just imagine she is with big juggs or belly. That model is still EXPERIMENTAL, and more expressions to be made later.
- Added 'Saved!' info when pressing the button 'Click to Save the Game' in the congratulations screen.
- Rule change: NOW, you CANT take the same blueprint if you revisit the level (in the case you took the same one before).
- Rule change: Toadette wont say "Better. Please keep dressed and sweep out these enemies the classic way!" if the princess finds her while clothed anymore, but '"Good morning! Please keep dressed and help Toadsworth do their chores in the castle!"'
- Rule change: Toadsworth will now be able to meet the princess after getting 'rescued' by her (he was deeply sleeping). Actually the 'silent' mode was on purpose, but now he can at least say something, like thank you, etc.
- Improved DEBUG text legibility on values. Some values were too small or joined together using 'Mario' font. Now 'Tahoma' font is used.
- BUG FIX: In level 4-6, the princess was unable to jump in some ledges be cause the bouncy mushroom platforms was low jump power.
- BUG FIX: In both first and second 'plant vine tentacle scene' (those ones that pull the princess upwards), it was locking her up in the end (cant progress in the level) and making her invisible, like in 3-3 level (tech info: function princessCenter using 'false' instead of '0').
- Glitch Fix: Annoying 'slish' semen sound when Toadette is fucked
- Glitch Fix: If carrying a key or a given object, and tring to climb a ladder/vine, the princess as always saying 'I can't climb while carrying this in my hands', even not pressing any button.
- Glitch Fix: a small one, where the princess appeared 'falling' a bit, after using the 'ghost doors' (the wooden ones, like in Grey Castle levels)
- Glitch Fix: The princess was being able to run even using shackles/a chain ball in her foot.
- Glitch Fix: When walking slowly in toad town, if you head to the forest area, sometimes the princess was going back to toad town immediatelly (in the black fadein/fadeout transition)
- Glitch Fix: The princess (while a Raccoon, Racer or a given powerup who gaver me more jump height) was not breaking blocks (tech info: more hitPoints needed for those).
- Glitch Fix: When changing the anal gaping from auto to closed, the game froze and reopening the game and loading a saved game resetted it altogether.
- Glitch Fix: The prinrcess was stuck when reaching world 6 from the cannon (tech info: misplacement).
- Glitch Fix: torso lacking when the princess talks while facing backside to us with a veggie/object in her hands
- Removal of grammar typos in the options and credits screen (thanks tyler_eli!)
- Small fixes like 'Peach Untold Tale' font in the intro screen being clickable (it should not be).

Update 3.15 (13th July 2016)
- NEW: A better HUD system. With fewer code, the game should be faster even with the HUD showing up fully. If you press BACKSPACE to hide it, messages wont be hidden anymore, so you can have dialogues and see 'tips' messages normally in this mode, as well as DEBUG mode (PAGE DOWN key). Before this update, pressing BACKSPACE made EVERYTHING hidden, including the dialogues (making the game unplayable in areas you needed to see what she and the creatures were saying).
- NEW: Thwomp Scene 4 (by Blargh)! Its also in the gallery.
- Finally, you can press DOWN (crouch mode) to make the camera also goes down (just as the slower camera in the AS2 version).
- The princess will be also pregnant if she is impregnated (20% chance in a vaginal scene) by a piranha and mushroom dicks.
- Glitch Fix: the princess was not popping out Wigglers (the centopedes) while jumping on it while 'running with open hands' (almost flying).
- Glitch Fix: Hammer Bro outfit without the shell.
- Glitch Fix: 'Days to deliver: 0 days' in Pregnancy screen instead of the correct days.
- Glitch Fix: Toad Town level banner was not appearing in the 'entering level screen'.
- Glitch Fix: Keyboard info (in Pause screen) not updating correctly according to region. For example, in default region (QWERTY), Config 4 (Single Left Hand), 'attack' key was 'A', but the correct is Z.
- Glitch Fix: the princess was being impregnated even with 'Can Be Pregnant' as NO in the options. 
- Glitch Fix: 'shred butt' area showing up for a glance when the princess is in backside mode while wearing certain outfits like 'Mario'.
- Glitch Fix: when the princess climbed a vine, then went to another area with no vine, she was still climbling.
- Glitch Fix: the cannon was not sending the princess to another world.
- Glitch Fix: when the princess used the 'white door' in the palace level (like 2-7) to exit to worldmap, or certain doors to return to that area, a blue screen appeared instead.
- Glitch Fix: when the princess threw a fireball (when in a Flower powerup) to a Koopaling, she was jumping by herself (without pressing jump key).
- Glitch Fix (NOT TESTED FULLY): when the princess returned from airship, she was not going to the bunker anymore, and even if going there by foot (by using pipes), the bunker computer still said she only has access to certain world(s) only. For example, the princess finished world 2, but the computer said she still has access only to world 2 instead of world 2 and world 3.
- Glitch Fix: 'Congratulations music' (SMB2 theme) was not playing when finishing the game.
- Some further optimizations to code
- Some adjustments to outfits (thanks Blargh!)

Update 3.14 (6th July 2016)
- GREAT IMPROVEMENT to worldmaps and some levels 'cpu speed'. They are now faster (less CPU usage).
- NEW: The princess will now say special phrases during certain dialogues depending on her current outfit status, horniness, etc. For example, if the princess talks with a Toad, she can say something about her exposed situation if she is naked or using an apron.
- NEW Ending: The Princess as a Queen of Osama! In order to unlock it, just let Osama fuck her three times, then finish the game without being a nymph.
- NEW 'game endings' screens. Those are NOT the 'previous success' screens like SMB1, but which whom the princess will be with. The 'virgin' and 'nymph' actions, for example, happens in the castle now, and with better/improved scenes.  And more: if you play as Daisy, Peach will be next to Luigi, not Mario. No new scenes yet (but some animations are there, like breathing and rubbing his body). In the future, we will also see Mario (or Luigi) and the current Princess going to marry in Marrymore (in its own scene).
- Improved 'Congratulations screen' art. Now if the princess hasnt made any sex, she will appear naked and embarrassed. If not, she will appear laid down with the onion on her...you know.
- Added 'Tump' sound if the princess touches a ceiling/roof while jumping or swimming.
- Now the princess will be pregnant if she is impregnated (20% chance in a vaginal scene) by buzzy beetles, bloopers (squids), birdoes, flurry, bumpty, cobrat, lakitu and ninji. So far, only 'egg-like' pregnancy.
- Rule change: now if the princess is using a 'non shreddable part' like Frog outfit (where she can lose the sling bikini but still retain her boots), she will lose just the sling, still retaining frog. Further hit will make her lose her entire powerup. The same with Fire Dress (she can be still a fire but only with her hells on), Tigeress, Penguin, Striker, ShyGirl and X-naut. Some outfits are really 'one-hit-to-lose-it-all', so if you change her custom outfits for powerups, the game will be a bit easier or harder!
- I decided to return the 'Y21>> strategy' for the camera, so creatures will not float in the air when the princess jumps or swims. 
- Rule change: After the congratulations screen, you will see the game ending, like 'virgin scene', nymph scene' and now 'peach and osama scene', THEN you will see all the Mario endings ('previous successes').
- Rule change: The 'score point' screen (which checks if you got a given amount of points before a Bowser ending) now runs AFTER all Mario endings.
- Glitch Fix: Lakitus not 'descending' towards the princess, so the pole would touch her.
- Glitch Fix: 'red trampoline' not making the princess jump (like in 6-2 level)
- Glitch Fix: The princess was not swimming up when 'Clean Cum if Underwater' was active while falling on water
- Glitch Fix: When pressing 'up' (if she is a Frog) or 'jump key' (if not) many times, the princess was not going up when the swimming motion ended, making her fall a bit before swimming up again.
- Glitch Fix: 'Blit in Background' option making some textures odd (perhaps there are more with odd behavior, I have to check).
- Glitch Fix: In 4-4, the 'exit door' may not making the princess end the level, but reappearing in a previous door (still in the level), locking herself in that level.
- Glitch Fix: In 4-3, there were 'blue voids' below the forest background.
- Glitch Fix: Princess and Daisy (in 2-7 palace level) locking the game up in 'Ass to Ass' scene (5th) when the playable princess has big boobs. This was a very insidious/hidden bug, as it was only happening with large boobs.
- Glitch Fix: when the princess touched a 'climb area', like a vine, while almost flying (all red arrows), upon stopping the effect was making her steady (no movement) while climbing.
- Glitch Fix: Black shell not appearing in the pricess with the hammerbro outfit/powerup.
- Glitch Fix: just a 'tip' of a inconvenience in the 'yellow paper/papirus' in transition events (like when the princess goes inside the cave in 6-6), as we could select them with the mouse (click and drag other the text). Those must not happen.


Update 3.13 (21th June 2016)
- NEW: Pregnancy added! She has a 20% chance of being pregnant after a given creature cums in her pussy. You will see a screen 'She is Pregnant!', then you will see a 'You're Pregnant' text in the HUD. For now, it will only work with koopas. She will lay an egg after a given amount of days passes while pregnant. You can't disable 'belly sizes' in the options during pregnancy (if you set 'NO' before, she will just be pregnant without having her belly increased). More creatures will be supported in later updates. You can see how many days left in the Pause Screen (near the heart icons in the top).  If its her 'day', and she starts to be dizzy, just PRESS DOWN to make her deliver it. You can disable this feature in the OPTIONS (Can be Pregnant: YES/NO).
- NEW: LadyBow scene 2 (boo dick insertion). It will happen if you visit Ghost Castle (in Worldmap 3) again. Its already in the gallery (when you unlock the Koopalings, just call Lady Bow main scene: It will show the first, then the second afterwards).
- NEW: Revamped LadyBow (humanized form). You can check this in LadyBow main scene (like in the ghost castle). Thank you TripFlip!
- Improved Koopa scene 5 (vaginal).
- Improved Ghost House level CPU usage (World 3).
- Adjusted Daisy head (to comply with kissing scenes for example. Not noticeable by the average player)
- Adjusted 'outer bra' (the dress bras), thank you Blargh!
- BUG FIX: When going to the 'exit door' to end the level, like in 1-1 and 1-2, if you press UP when the princess is 'not in the front of the door', but just a bit to the left or right, the princess was locking herself down in 'walking' state.
- BUG FIX: The 'screw' platforms was not letting the princess jump in the Airship of World 6. The princess just trespassed it. In Super Mario 3, if you dont jump, Mario trespasses it and falls, but if you jump, you get the grip (of the floor), making it rotate.
- BUG FIX: The princess was locking herself when talking to Daisy in her bedroom (2-7 level)
- BUG FIX: The princess was locking herself up in the bathroom (in bar area of Toad Town level).
- Glitch Fix: When disabling PROTECTION, certain enemies like Nipper Plants (the 'always chomping' plants on the ground) was making the princess 'ethernally locked on them', because just after the princess was free, they took her again and again (tech info: when not protected, the engine still needs to give some time for the player to be able to get away on time, a kind of residual invulnerability which is less than one second).
- Glitch Fix: Mario scene 3 not working in World 7.
- Glitch Fix: The return pipe of worldmap 6 (Delfino Plaza) was not working since Update 2.3.11 (4th March 2015), as no one noticed it. People were unable to return to Peach Castle from there, although they could try to beat world 6, as world 7 pipe was working.
- Glitch Fix: Annoying 'boeing' sound when seeing Toad fucking Toadette (tech info: soundFXNear).
- Glitch Fix: Lady Bow scene not working correctly (Tech info: Need to be if (!Mutex), not Mutex))
- Glitch Fix: The princess was 'locking herself up' when jumping in shallow ledges, like in Ghost House level (Tech info: the new state machine not detecting falling grav on time. Solution: Forced state change in end-jump).


Update 3.12 (13th June 2016)
- NEW Achievement Art: Flurry, the snowman (Thanks to TripFlip). You know how to unlock it: 'Go into lascivious acts with snowmen until you got all unicque scenes done'. This achievement is dynamic, that is, there are animated things occurring on it, like the snowfall in the end.
- Rule change: Now, if you drop her crown or earrings, or she loses it in any situation, you need to take a 'compliant outfit' that has a crown/earrings to get it back. These are: Classic Dress,Brawl Dress, Fire Dress, Raccoon, Striker,Daisy Dress,Rosa Dress,Daisy Striker,Shadow Queen,Wedding Dress,Peachy Racer and Catsuit. If the princess loses a life, she will recover her crown and earrings.
- BUG FIX: Red muhsrooms 'repeating all the time' when the princess touched it with her boobs at maximum (huge tits), and this was triggering other bugs along the level
- BUG FIX: Morton action (sex scene) crashing the princess and him when he cummed.
- BUG FIX: The princess wasnt being able to exit the vase after getting the key inside.
- Glitch Fix: The princess in catsuit powerup wasnt galloping during levels.
- Glitch Fix: Adjustments to springs/trampolines/platforms (since the new state machine, the princess wasnt jumping properly on them).
- Glitch Fix: Adjustments to Cataquacks (they were fucking the princess even if she isnt falling over him, and they were running 'over water' if the princess was horny and jumped into water).
- Glitch Fix: Chompette taking the princess even if she is not touching her
- Glitch Fix: Moved Chompette a bit 'down' to avoid creatures to 'trespass her' and have their feet beneath it, like the toad ones (just a layer glitch).
- Other glitches fixed (thank you Adan!)

Update 3.11 (23th May 2016) - 'All for more performance'
- NEW: 'State Pattern' code to the princess character. This was desired since Version 1.6h: (3rd october 2012), as her code was procedural until recently. It's an important achievement. Now its easier to add new states or poses like 'sliding with her butt' or else. Bugs regarding states/poses will be fewer, and easier to fix. Also, game performance might increase from 0.5 to 1fps.
- Improved 'large objects as Sprite' - LargeSpri methodology. Game performance might increase from 0.5 to 3fps.
- Improved game performance in level 4-4 and worldmap using 'noShowIfSector' with 'Bitmap cache' methodology.
- The princess can describe more items in Toadette's room (Peach Castle level).
- Rule change: the princess will be able to throw the object/veggie only if standing up (stopped) or jumping. This avoids the case she is walking and you press RUN key by mistake. Before, she would throw the veggie and stop, being easily taken by enemies during that moment.
- The princess will now fall with a better behavior (e.g. if she reaches ground, she will stop for a glance, before walking/running/jumping again).
- Its now possible to zoom in bosses, like Morton.
- Glitch Fix: When the princess left the 'blue dildo' scene in TEC-XXX room, she wasnt standing up tenderly (she already appeared straight up).
- Glitch Fix: Goomba King with a 'disallocated' dick in certain poses.
- Glitch Fix: In 6-6, the princess was falling through the ground when she returned from the grotto entrance back to the forest and walked left.
- Glitch Fix: Charlieton walking out of his stand in level 7-5 (Glitzville).
- Glitch Fix: checkpoint bath still not allowing us to click in its buttons
- Glitch Fix: sometimes when leaving the gallery during a scene there, the princess was locked up in the same pose (she moved, but without animations).
- Glitch Fix: turning off 'Waterfall' sounds in the options wasnt working

Update 3.1 - RELEASE  (14th May 2016)
- This is the SECOND official RELEASE of a working game with no found bugs (so far), after many testing. The FIRST release where we got NO game-breaking bugs (just rare glitches) were the update 2.1.7 (18th april 2014). Below, bugs and glitches already fixed in the release.
- NEW: Yoshi can RUN away if the princess is attacked or an enemy touches her while on yoshi.
- NEW: You can now use LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN during scenes to move the blue crosshair (it will disappear after 1 second after you release those keys, so it wont be on your way), then press '-' to zoom where it is/was! You can click anywhere in the screen with the mouse too, but if you click far away, you will need to keep clicking to return to the maxed out zoom in order to click in the desired scene focus.
- NEW: Princess 'cake' scene. In order to make the princess do it, a large cake needs to be baked (by Zess T). When the princess has a scene with Zess T, a large cake will be there in the next day by 50% chance.
- RULE CHANGE: Now you can change her belly (Belly Can Increase) freely in the options (to avoid confusion when the button just doesnt work, because you were required to go to the castle or worldmap). BUT when the pregnancy is in the game in the future, a message will tell you cant 'disable' belly sizes in this situation.
- INFO: 'DEBUG warning screen' added. If anyone uses the Flash Projector Debug version, the game will work as well, but slower and with annoying popups because of the debug version itself. So that screen is just to inform the player those can happen during the game. Those are not 'truly errors' but false positives or cases where objects are cleaned up but still called. The engine will remove garbage over time anyway. You can try to see if you can desactivate those messages.
- INFO: Added 'TOTAL' text to counters in Pause Screen (Coins, Total Laids, Total Kills and BluePrints), and 'Per Level' text for Laids and Kills in the HUD. Those two are reseted in each level, but they are always added to the total counters.
- OPTIMIZATION: Removed inner 'mouse listeners' to all objects in the current level.
- OPTIMIZATION: FIXED/DECREASED 'Spring' phenomenum of creatures and items when the princess jumps or the camera moves in Y axis: GraIM (Grav Add If Moved) and LimGrav Strategy. Intensive levels like 1-1 might still show some of this phenomenum (they might float for a bit), but enemies may not trespass the ground anymore.
- Rule change: When taking RED cherries along the levels, her belly will increase in 33% of the time. If PURPLE cherries (poison), it will increase in 100% of the time. In HARD game mode, both will make her increase 100% of the time, while the red cherries may make her dizzy/drunk in 33% of the time.
- Rule change: Thwomp scene 3 (pussy fuck) now takes the princess' virginity (if any).
- Rule change: the princess will keep dizzy/drunk in fewer seconds after certain scenes like Boos, to avoid being taken by him endlessly (making the scenes annoying).
- Rule change: Only later boo scenes (like 4th and 5th) will make the princess dizzy either in easy or hard game mode. If hard game mode, all scenes might make her dizzy.
- Rule change: Only LOAD game hotkeys are in the game. Press SHIFT+1 until SHIFT+5 to load any of them, regardless of the current keyboard config.
- BUG FIX: When the princess has many scenes with toads (more than 25), both toad(s) and her disappeared (tech info: NaN due to Flags.Max which does not exist).
- BUG FIX: Lakitu and Thwomp scenes locking the princess up after loading a save (tech info: customDialogueBalloonScene)
- BUG FIX: When the princess stomped Bobomb buddy (in the bunker level near her castle), a blue screen was appearing, locking the entire game up.
- BUG FIX: When the princess fell from the airship, she was disappearing upon reaching the palace' ground.
- BUG FIX: When the princess knocked Ludwig (the Koopaling) down, he was staying in the floor and the airship level wasnt ending up.
- BUG FIX: When reaching the worldmap after certain levels like the grey castle, when someone talks to the princess, like the toad, the message was repeating over and over.
- Glitch Fix: When saving the game, then RESTARTING THE GAME or quickly loading another slot, the princess was with the current changed character of the gallery and with default values (coins 0, laids 0, etc). Tech info: loadinfo CLEAR and loadinfo NULL needed!
- Glitch Fix: when clicking RESTART GAME after saving, the game was overriding the current saved slot (so, the freshy saved game was being lost). Tech info: it was loading the refreshed new created loadinfo[slot], making all local changes right in the new game (like changing princess character in the gallery) permanent to that gameplay.
- Glitch Fix: Certain pipes not working in 7-1 and 7-2
- Glitch Fix: When throwing or letting a custom key fall (like the red one), upon taking it again, it was changing colors back to gold.
- Glitch Fix: When saving the game in certain levels like 7-2, loading it again would only make 7-1 avaiable in the worldmap.
- BUG FIX: In level 7-3, when climbing the tower, after hitting the box to release the vine to reach the cloud you need to stand on to jump into the pipe, once you jump into the pipe, the screen went blue.
- BUG FIX: When some x-nauts talked to the princess, the dialogue locked herself up.
- Glitch Fix: some doors not being opened in level 7-5.
- Glitch Fix: In level 6-4, cant open wooden toilet doors (in ladies toilet).
- Glitch Fix: Cant click in Toadella text balloons in her castle.
- Glitch Fix: Yoshi egg not breaking in 7-2
- Glitch Fix: Yoshi making the camera locked in Y axis
- Glitch Fix: The princess wasn't getting unmounted when an enemy or a hazardous object touched Yoshi with her.
- Glitch Fix: Odd behavior when saving in the worldmap or in certain levels. By loading it again later, the princess reappeared in her castle entrance instead of the saved level.
- Glitch Fix: Strange sounds of shyguys in 3-1 and 3-3 (but we couldnt encounter them)
- Glitch Fix: the princess couldnt enter certain vases in 3-2 and 3-3.
- Glitch Fix: when the princess gets into a scene while carrying the 'ice cream pot' (beige with red roof), she wanst getting in the scene and the pot werent falling to the ground.
- Glitch Fix: Double door sounds when the princess enters on it (those red doors in levels like 3-1).
- Glitch Fix: When putting 'Shred Bra' to 'None' in the options, then leaving and re-entering the options screen, it was getting back to 'Biggest' because the option wasnt being changed.
- Glitch Fix: 'P blocks' (those who turn golden bricks as coins) stopped working.
- Glitch Fix: Nibbles (sharp-teeth fish) and Wigglers not being killed by fireballs or veggies. 
- Glitch Fix: Pokeys (cactus creatures) flying around if touched by fireballs or veggies.
- Glitch Fix: Goombella sometimes was moving left or right while 'not walking with her feet' (she was kind of slipping).
- Glitch Fix: Toadsworth without his bed scene and 'talking scenes'
- Glitch Fix: Charlieton was taking only ONE coin from the princess (at each of his wares).
- Glitch Fix (AN OLD ONE NOBODY detected): Princess unable to leave the 2 pipes (special rooms) in level 1-5.

- Glitch Fix: Quick LOAD game slot shortcuts not working.
- Glitch Fix: Princess 'Toilet' scene buttons in the gallery doesnt work.

- Glitch Fix: In 9-1, if the princess said TEC-XXX was right in the case she wanted to go to the corridors naked, but upon dressing herself, TEC-XXX wasnt talking anymore, locking her up in her captive room 'forever'.
- Other small fixes.

Update 3.0b9 (30th April 2016) - Yet another SERVICE UPDATE.
(WARNING, older saved games are totally deprecated! Cause: gallery system is in a much better class structure).
- NEW! Added 'Princess removing key from her asshole to unlock the door' to the gallery!
- NEW! Osama 'seated' scene. To see it, the princess needs to enter in his palace (wordmap 3) almost totally horny (like 90%) or a nymph, and the airship of world 3 might be already beaten in order to interact with him.
- Some dialogues like the princess in a bed, seating in a train chair, and closet scene now accepts 'SPACE' (or your current 'next scene' key) as default to go away (leave), provided the dialogue has this option. The plan is to convert all dialogues, so that key will be the default one to leave in all circunstances, except during scenes, as you need to keep pressing space until the end (except if you configured NEXT SCENE to AUTOMATICALLY loop once or twice in the options).
- Optimization: I tried to implement a static camera (StaticR strategy) but many bugs started to appear, as this entity is much more complex to handle (for example, the princess cant access Vcam.x, but Vcam.instance.x. This would also be counter intuitive, as the following member access (x.y.z.w...) uses actually more CPU. ABORTED/ROLLBACK!
- Optimization: Nonetheless, I did optimized the camera engine a bit more (e.g. I dont do 'width/2' calculations all the time anymore, but I cache it as 'widthHalf', an int variable).
- Optimization: the 'screenList' engine object wont follow the camera (even in invisible mode) anymore. Only when its needed.
- Improvements to the 'chain claw' scene (the mechanical hands in Egadds lab). The princess disappeared for some microsseconds before the main scene, and when she fell in the end, she reappeared falling again, but upright.
- DEBUG MODE: added the current camera location in the screen when PAGE DOWN is pressed.
- BUG FIX: When exiting a level right when she enters on it (going to the brown keep), a blue screen appeared in.
- BUG FIX: When exciting the Koopa Prison after getting Game Over, the screen just turns blue and the game requires a restart.
- BUG FIX: Losing virginity locking up the game (like in the closet scene and in all enemies that breaks her virginity) - Cause: new Flags/Config system
- BUG FIX: When the princess plays with all scenes with a given creature, she disappears (game locks up), like goomba and koopa 'triple' scenes.
- BUG FIX: several scenes not working due to the general optimizations that mangled it up.
- BUG FIX: X-naut shower bath stopped working.
- BUG FIX: When all Thwomp scenes are seen (like 3 or a bit more), the princess was disappearing in the next random scene (tech info: scene0 didnt exist due to wrong rand).
- Glitch Fix: Certain walking bobombs (like in 1-6) not taking the princess anymore when he stops walking and the princess touches him befor exploding (tech info: gravity acting on him while movement is false, assuming isTouchingGround false, while the scene itself requires this to be true).
- Glitch Fix: Krystal nipples were not showing up (tech info: nipple types not configured for frame Krystal 9, only max 8).
- Glitch Fix: Phantos still following the princess after putting a key in the locked door
- Glitch Fix: The princess was still being warped to the pole in 6-4 (in the bar) instead of the beginning of 6-4 level.
- Glitch Fix: DO OVER KEY ('E') in keyboard type 4 (single right hand) wasnt working.
- Glitch Fix: When random enemies appeared in screen in HARD GAME mode, they were trying to change to certain races or colors, like a cleft trying to be 'red', but he doesnt have that race. Although the player would not notice it, the game was a bit slower due to those.
- Glitch Fix: Enemies not attacking the princess in hard mode (tech info: obj.root.EnemyMax not more available, and Object converted from AS2, if new Object() explicitally, doesnt retain order)
- Glitch Fix: When going to another area, if the same music, it was getting restarted instead of keeping it on (an odd/annoying effect).
- Glitch Fix: When restarting the game over and over again, the first level was the last played one, plus 1 (e.g. If you played 1-3 and restarted the entire game, it would play 1-4 instead of Peach Castle again), aside of all previous settings and game situations of the previous play.
- Glitch Fix: when you try to click in any of the pink save buttons while in a normal level (like 1-3 or 2-4), the button did nothing.
- Glitch Fix: when you lower the maximum boob size it stay at biggest. But when after that, making the maximum boob size larger again made it change.
- Glitch Fix: The princess horny bar was getting reset at each new level.
- Glitch Fix: When Merlee talked to the princess in 7-5 level, sometimes she said 'Undefined'.
- Glitch Fix: In the closet scene, sometimes the princess can 'fall' into a toad, but the item '1) Masturbate' still appeared. I also added 'This Door is Locked! But it opened in other days...' if she tries to open the left door, giving a hint that, in other days, it can be opened (new scenes there).

Update 3.0b8 (20th April 2016)
- NEW! Now the princess can 'go up' inside the rainbow bubbles in Level 4-4! Just jump on them!
- BUG FIX: Toad doctor scene (like in the infirmary of Peach's Castle) making the princess disappear.
- BUG FIX: Jabbi scene 1 locking the Princess up in certain situations (tech info: Friend gallery call with Reference error due to AS2 to AS3 conversion)
- Glitch Fix: Princess buoyancy was very high (a corruption in a flag setting).
- Glitch Fix: Princess and creature 'hearts' that grow up when they love werent working.
- Glitch Fix: Even with 'AssHole state being SWOLLEN' in the options, the doctor scene wasnt happening.
- Glitch Fix: The toad in the kitchen house (level 1-1) was with no text in its balloon.
- Glitch Fix: In level 4-4, when showering in the rainbow waterfall, the princess messagebox 'The Princess Removed Clothes' appeared, but upon clicking space, the screen blinked (black) then returned, but the messagebox wasn't disapearing.
- Other fixes and General optimizations to the game.

Update 3.0b7 (17h April 2016) - WARNING, older saved games are totally deprecated!
- NEW: Shygirl Lap Dance scene (In Shyguy Town in world 3). The princess needs to be a nymph to engage in it. Its a small scene but with two varieties if you wait enough.
- NEW! 'Reset Saves' button in the loader screen. This fixes up many problems with older save slots and the older settings slot. You can still try to load saved text files (b64) from the clipboard in the Load Screen though. If the game doesnt load properly there, a message 'corrupted file' will show up but the game wont crash with 'variable not found' errors. Just play the game normally.
- Improvement to 'teleport' cheat. If there are walls or prohibited areas, a message will say: 'COLLISION HIT! Try another area!'
- Optimization to classes engine (Tech info: Less dependence of MovieClip(root) calls). Creation of unicque config classes. Game performance expected to increase.
- The princess will now be cured of 'drunk' status if she takes any powerup other than Poison.
- BUG FIX: Ninji achievement art was going back to Chuck art and the text and problems with the text length.
- BUG FIX: Star Hill level (worldmap 4) not centering the camera.
- BUG FIX: Flickering area inside a hut in 4.3 level.
- Glitch Fix: Certain E-gadd dialogue situations locking the princess up.
- Glitch Fix: The player was able to leave Hentai Screens (those in the achievements) by pressing CTRL (menu key). It must not happen because important unlock and other code will execute in the end of those screens.
- Glitch Fix: After falling over Osama (coming from Airship from world 3), after the scene starts, you can move left/right strangely.
- Glitch Fix: ? Block in 4-3 level (Mushrom/Flower powerup) not working
- Glitch Fix: When using a powerup via inventory in the worldmap, depending on the powerup (like the Dress outfit), the princess was walking slower in the worldmap.
- Glitch Fix: Hammerbro powerup was not being taken in 4-3 level.

Update 3.0b6 (15th April 2016)
- NEW! Toadsworth will have a new dialogue with the princess before the bed scene, explaining how to treat people who are drowned or fainted: you guess what!
- NEW! Ninji's achievement art by TripFlip with its descriptive text (its tale)! Just fuck all of them to unlock it! Remember you can see it once (if you play as any of the princess), but you will only collect the achievements to be seen later if you play as a Peach character (like Peach, Fire Peach, Peach PS and Tanned Peach).
- Improvement to invisible block mechanism. Now, the princess cant walk over them when invisible, except if she finds them by breaking them. This avoids them to be noticied when she jumps around to check if there is something hidden that doesnt make her fall through it. Also remember that when the princess loses a life, only certain 1ups and powerups blocks reappear. Coinboxes may not restart.
- BUG FIX: Chomp scene 5 locking the princess up.
- BUG FIX: Cheep Cheep scene 3 locking the princess up.
- Glitch Fix: when taking a shower in the checkpoint bath, if you press 'Ass Back' or 'Pussy Front' buttons, she couldnt change poses anymore until re-entering the bath.
- Glitch Fix: when progressing through levels, like finishing up 1-1 and 1-2, when saving them (1-3 being opened), loading that game later was reseting level situations (making the player redo 1-1 and other levels of a particular world). Cannon saves werent affected by this.
- Glitch Fix: Mushroom Dicks scene not happening anymore, making the Princess lose the blue Interact button in all areas.
- Glitch Fix: intrincate problem with dialogue scenes when you talk to the same creature. Sometimes, due to 'relay code', the first phrase are not said. Like when Toadsworth expected to say 'Toadsworth: Hello, my dear Princess! what can I do for you, my dear?'. Instead of this, the princess started already saying '(Press a Number)\n1) Any news about Mario?' like we pressed 'NEXT' key beforehand. (tech info: let lastPressed to an unicque value in the end of each dialogue)

Update 3.0b5 (14th April 2016) - WARNING, older saved games are totally deprecated!
- NEW! (A so-awaited feature): Saving and Loading FROM EXTERNAL text file! In order to use this feature when saving, go to the SAVE button and select the Clipboard icon. Then just open a text editor and PASTE the contents (CTRL+V) then save as a TXT or B64 extension, like 'MIM PUT SAVE1.txt'. To load it again, go to the LOAD game screen, then select 'FROM FILE'.
- NEW: Merlee character with some dialogues. Her tent can be found in Level 6-6 and in Toad Forest (just go to Toad Town and head to the far right). Sometimes its not there because her tent is in level 6-6. She prefers to be there. So far, you can only enter in her tent at 6-6. No scenes/fortune telling yet.
- FIVE Princess poses improved by Blargh, like embarassing walk, running, drunk walking, nymph walk and 'almost flying' (running with opened arms)
- NEW option (ON/OFF): 'Classic Nymph Gait' (for those who prefer the classic one where the Princess walk with a higher gait). 
- BUG Fix: Poochy lick scene. When the princess hits the floor to be licked, sometimes she locks up.
- BUG Fix: The princess was being locked up with a strange black chainball in certain levels when her belly was bigger and she was going to fart ('farting cum pose') due to a poison or something else she ate.
- Glitch Fix: Ludwig gallery button not working.
- Glitch Fix: Princess nail color wasnt changing from WHITE color in the Outfit Room screen.

- Glitch Fix: Yellow rubber duck toilet may spawn double princess if you 'pee' on it, then go away.
- Glitch Fix: Strange 'colorful boob caps' in Krystal (with certain outfits) and her nipples were missing.
- BUG Fix: In the first area, level B (the bonus level), after interacting with the chain chomp at the end, the princess get moved to the right of him and die.

Update 3.0b4 (10th April 2016) - Compiled in CPU acceleration mode instead of GPU.
- NEW! E.gadd full dialogue scene! Now the princess can talk to him regarding the usage of the spaceship, and a quest to find what E.gadd needs. He will tell her if she gathered what he wanted or how many left. Then he will work to fix what he needs to and a new achievement art will appear in, with cute scenes and poses.
- HINT: Remember that achievement screens will be seen in all scenes that shows them up, like with bosses, even if you're not playing with a Peach character (instead of Daisy, Rosalina and Krystal) but the achievement board screen WONT BE FILLED because that feature is unicque for Peach. In order to see them at full glory, well, play as Peach or her variances.
- NEW: Princess 'bending backside' and swinging her butt to us if she is a Nymph and you let her standing up for a while (but she may also masturbate so you may need to wait for her decision to do it).
- CHANGED 'GPU rendering' back to 'CPU/DIRECT rendering'. Some people noticed an increase of 2 to 4 fps in the entire game. GPU is more used for flash videos anyway. If someone thinks GPU was faster for their machines, give me a proof of that and I may create two different deploys.
- ADJUSTED 'Hog Holes'. Before, they were respawning even if the princess was far away, once she was near them while horny at least once in the level. Now, she must be horny enough keep near them in order to make more appear from those holes.
- BUG FIX: Birdo scene 3 locking the princess up. (tech info: Reference error due to AS2 to AS3 conversion)
- BUG FIX: Locked door area of level 2-3 was being opened with a key, but the princess was kind of locked up, like an invisible wall was still there.
- BUG FIX: Mario scene 6 locking the princess up. (tech info: Reference error due to AS2 to AS3 conversion)
- BUG FIX: In the CONGRATULATIONS (Peach facing us) screen, if you check all the endings, then press KEEP PLAYING button in Super Mario RPG ending screen (wihere Mario is seat in a big yellow star), a strange black screen was covering part of Peach's Castle level.
- BUG FIX: If a nymph princess mastubates then cums, if you press any key to make her stand up and then you go to the pause menu in this state, she will be locked up in the beginning of her masturbate position, like she is going to do it again, but she werent moving anymore. Only DEL (losing a life) would fix this.
- Glitch Fix: when clicking in any of the SAVE button in the worldmap (in the load/save table in the HUD at right), the blue LOAD button wasnt working anymore.
- Glitch Fix: goombas not sleeping after the scenes.
- Glitch Fix: yet more of those blue sound boxes not giving any hint, like in levels 2-2 and 2-3.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was falling through the first quicksand of 2-2 if she jumps in the right edge of it. It was like she was passing through a tiny area between the quicksand wall and the right sandy wall.
- Glitch Fix: Lady Bow (in BOSSES button) and Boo scenes were with inverted text balloons in the gallery
- Glitch Fix: a quickly 'blinking' white message (Press SPACE to continue) while masturbating. 
- Glitch Fix: after going to Ending 4, the 'Game Over' werent leading you to more scenes (like virgin/shore scenes and the coinage screen), but the 'Congratulations' screen.
- Glitch Fix: the princess was not getting her temporary invulnerable protection just after starting any level.
- Other small improvements and fixes.

Update 3.0b3 (7th April 2016) - Another Service Pack

- ADDED 'Cancel' button when clicking 'Save' in the Pause Screen.
- Mouse Events now require you to press AND depress. This avoids the 'oh I pressed that by mistake!' You can just keep the button pressed, move the cursor out of the button, then depress it.
- OPTIMIZED memory usage in many screens, like options, outfit room and gallery.
- Rearranged Outfit Room and added 'Belly Size' and 'Ass Size'. ATTENTION: Ass Sizes STILL TO BE MADE.
- BUG FIX: Mario's bed (in Mario's Pad level) locking the princess up. (tech info: Reference error due to AS2 to AS3 conversion)
- BUG FIX: Jinx scene 3 locking the princess up. (tech info: Reference error due to AS2 to AS3 conversion)
- BUG FIX: Chomp scene 5 locking the princess up. (tech info: Reference error due to AS2 to AS3 conversion)
- BUG FIX: Shyguy scene 10 locking the princess up. (tech info: Reference error due to AS2 to AS3 conversion)
- BUG FIX: In the Prison area (post Game Over), the princess was not interacting with the gloryhole, thus not apt to leave the metal door and the wooden door.
- Glitch FIX: Flurry scene 4 button not working in the gallery
- Glitch FIX: Green trampolines not working (like in world 6 levels)
- Glitch FIX: When unlocking each achievement, it wasn't showing up straight away, only once another achievement gets unlocked. for example, if you unlocked achievement 1, It will not show up in the achievement menu until achievement 2 is unlocked.
- Glitch FIX: Belly doesnt shrink on toilet (more tests needed)
- Glitch FIX: Belly and Boob changes werent working. Even if its already known that choosing a custom boob size in the Outfit Room wont affect the Princess in the level, the size should at least appear in her showroom for comparison.
- Glitch FIX: Achievement screen causing memory leaks.
- Glitch FIX: Modifying boob size in the showroom were changing speed/height sensation to the princess, but those was not getting nulified when going back to the level. Actually speed changes should only happen if the princess gets her boobs changed during the level.
- Glitch FIX: A strange tree in the foreground (floating tree in the front of creatures) in 1-1.
- Glitch FIX: 'Describe text' button in achievement images that had text werent showing up
- Glitch FIX: The key that comes from goomba in 1-3 was doubled when the princess gets it in Nymph mode.
- Other small fixes

Update 3.0b2 (2nd April 2016) - If people ask why those bugs persist, thats because a few people tested the refactored game (AS3 version) so far. So I am fixing the remaining ones as soon as they are found.
- NEW: Pirate Mug 'Stroking' scene (when the princess talks to him) like in the levels with Bars.

- NEW: Checkpoints now have Peach's pinky flag.
- Princess Portrait will now show the current cum situation like in the HUD and in the next level screen.
- Yet another improvement to nulify camera interference to creatures with gravity when the princess jumps. I call it 'Y21>> strategy'
- Yet another improvement to make certain objects to appear correctly (tech info: 'Timeline.exec mcs' with pre-config during current scene work like 'thigh.garterXHide=true only on frame 2 onwards).
- BUG FIX: Jinx dialogue option locking the Princess up (tech info: Reference error due to AS2 to AS3 conversion)
- BUG FIX: 3 Monty Mole scenes still locking the Princess up (tech info: Reference error due to AS2 to AS3 conversion)

- BUG FIX: When using certain showers (checkpoint shower, x-naut shower bath, etc), when leaving them, SPACEBAR presses (or any other set key for next scene, like SHIFT or E) was still making her 'leave' the bathroom, making her retrieve her used clothes like she is still taking a bath.

Update 3.0b (22th March 2016)
- Added LISTENER counts (Ev-listeners and Ep-listeners) in DEBUG screen (Page Down key). The idea is to keep tracking them, in order to check if they remain as low as possible (less than 600). I ask people, if possible, to inform me which levels/scenes/areas/princess poses are making those numbers grow. Thats because they need to remain close to the starting number (e.g. in the beginning of Peach Castle, there is 560 Ev-listeners or a bit more, and 150 to 200 Ep-listeners. In the end of the level, it must remain 600 and 200 respectively at most, not 1000 each, for example). The game might be slow if that count trespasses 2,000, and this can indicate a memory leak.
- Improved listener counts and more countermeasures to refrain memory leak.
- Improved 'first screen' (loader screen), with a detection of your current Flash version in bottom-left area. Link buttons work better, as well as the customized right click.
- Less to no more 'spring' effect of camera on creatures (vcam stage -lasty tracking with '5' division)
- Wario standing-up scene (like in the bar): changed the second 'Wario blue box' to 'Princess pink box', as she will be answering him. So, options like '2' changed to 'Show Wario you have coins', and 'Leave her alone' changed to 'LEAVE'.
- When masturbating while 'showing her back to us' (like in the bed) she will be using her other hand to stimulate other areas instead of just letting it a bit over her thigh.
- Level 6-4: Added dialogue to the 'Football players audience' in the bar.
- Level 9-1: Added more expressions to Princess when she talks with TEC-XXX in the concoctionator rooms.
- Level 9-1: Added more hint messages so you wont feel so lost in the level, like when the Princess says 'Enough of this! I'll take a rest', an additional message will tell you need to masturbate in the bed so you will sleep and TEC-XXX can talk to you later.
- Level 9-1: The Princess will now get drunk for a bit if she takes the right potion to be invisible.
- BUG FIX: Certain boss endings still not progressing to the 'falling airship from the sky' area (tech info: goMainScreen with AirShipFall)
- BUG FIX: Level 6-2 not working.
- BUG FIX: In Hard Game mode, enemies were not appearing anymore
- BUG FIX: In Hard Game mode, xnauts were trying to 'make the princess go back to her room', as if the level is 9-1.
- BUG FIX: when using the 'black metal door' of the Fortress level (7-3), then going there again (or in certain new levels), strange objects, like the entire screen/camera from the former 7-3 level weren't being removed.
- BUG FIX: Jabbis ('flies') crashing up.
- BUG FIX: Blooper 'fuck' scene locking the Princess up if she was not virgin yet.
- BUG FIX: Pressing NEXT SCENE (Space or other set key) in the Game Over screen was locking the game up (black screen)
- BUG FIX: up to FOUR toad scenes still locking the Princess up depending on the Next Scene.
- BUG FIX (have to test more): when the princess answered a X-naut with option '4) I want to...love you!', sometimes the damsel was getting locked up (with no scene at all).
- Glitch Fix: 'total black' backgrounds in some areas, like it was a starless night. Although there are indeed night levels, those generally have stars.
- Glitch Fix: When losing a life in the same level, powerup blocks returns to their initial state, but the princess couldnt break them anymore.
- Glitch Fix: Daisy and Peach (in Palace level) still with some problems with their bodyparts, and Daisy's clothing pile was not showing in the floor after she removed clothes.
- Glitch Fix: The pole in 6-4 (in the bar) was acting like a finish pole (The current Princess was being able to descend on it, with the fanfare music).
- Glitch Fix: The 'sound box' in 1-1 (next to the four trees) and 1-6 (grey castle) werent working.
- Glitch Fix: strange phenomena of camera following the walking bobomb like in 1-6 level when the princess touches him.

Update 3.0a9 (17th March 2016)
- NEW: Yet Another CPU+ Setting (YACS): 'Blit in Background'. A powerful function that generates a bitmap version of many background objects, so those will be faster to walk around. ON (YES) as default! You should activate it if the game is slow. If you deactivate it, those objects will be crystal clear and animated in expense of more CPU usage! Pay attention that, if you change it, it will only affect the NEXT Level. There are 3 other CPU+ options, dont forget to try them out too.
- Stronger text color / appearance in the Options Screen
- Changed 'Z' key (A in AZERTY) to 'E' in SINGLE LEFT HAND keyboard type (due to requests). 'E' was put back to 'Z'. People confirmed E is better as a USE button. 
- Better pussy for the frontside Princesses in the Pause Screen.
- Remake of the drawers feature, like in ther bedroom. Now it will be in a dialogue system (the three buttons were acting wrongly).
- Improvement to 'clothing pile' feature. When the current princess remove clothes, it will appear in the floor/retrieved in a better way.

- Glitch Fix: 'Living Boo Platforms' creatures not working in Ghost Castle level.

Update 3.0a8 (13th March 2016)
- WARNING! Flash Player 18, 19, 20, 21 and maybe later versions are PRONE to GAME MALFUNCTION. Please use Firefox (in case of Flash 20 or later) or use the STANDALONE Flash Player (projector version) 18 or earlier (the best version for this game is Flash 11, 12, until 17) in case you play it offline in a desktop PC/laptop. Further investigations says Flash 20 is the worse!
- Optimization to Daisy/Shygirl code
- Improvement to the current Princess expressions (PES)
- Improvement to Princess Expression engine, like in dialogues. For example, if she is naked, but grabbing a object/veggie, she wont cover herself and make it fall.
- Improvement of Princess and Toadella bath scene. She is more dynamic (better animations), you can press SPACE to advance (not only the buttons) and if the princess is totally horny, she will cum and the scene will end sooner. You need to be bathed again if you want more.
- Total rewrite of Zess-T code (no more text balloons, except during the main scene). It now uses the modern dialogue system of message boxes.
- BUG FIX: After beating the boss (e.g. Morton), the screen wasnt advancing to the next screen (thus, no way to leave the airship area).
- BUG FIX: Goomba 'Upside Slip' scene locking the Princess up.
- BUG FIX: More improvements to 9-1 level. It was locking up (Tele monitor interference), the princess was NOT returning back to 'visible' in Grodus room in certain times, and the princess was NOT going back to her room as 'visible' when she loses a life in the level (due to a Yux attack, for example).
- BUG FIX: in Worldmap 9 worldmap (base entrance), the princess was locking up when talking to x-naut guard, when he says "You're busted"!
- BUG FIX: Zess-T (chef): she was saying "Put your Apron on" but when walking up to it, she can't put it on. When clicking the blue icon above the chef, and try to move the princess, she was always facing the right side.
- BUG FIX: trying to mount the Swan in Peach's castle and when pressing masturbate or Leave, she gets stuck frozen in place.
- BUG FIX: getting the Toadella glitch at the bath near the Kitchen. When asking her to clean me she doesn't get frozen anymore until choosing one of the four options or click 'All Done' then they both get frozen into place. 
- Glitch Fix: yet some buttons in the options menu, Maximum Cum not updating the text correctly and hidden errors in Stationary Camera and HUD settings before the game starts. Also, 'game quality' and 'clean cum while underwater' were not being reset when DEFAULT button was pressed.

Update 3.0a6 (9th March 2016) 
- Rule Change: Now the princess will lose a life if she is squished (like in scrolling levels) or she is locked up inside walls (like in certain glitches). This avoids anti gravity and other engine code throwing the princess to void areas, even crashing up the entire level.
- New cheat: if you press '7 and 0' (both numbers pressed) when 'main cheat mode' is unlocked (refer to page 1 of MIM PUT threads in LOK or Aedler forums), you will alter between 'all airships beaten' and 'all airships back' modes, so you can revisit the Koopalings, Daisy and Osama (with their different scenes and modes), etc.
- A possible fix to the loading time (preloader). The intro screen may appear sooner, but some white screen might still appear.
- Increased Princess and Daisy text balloons (they were too small)
- BUG FIX: 9-1: The princess cannot interact with TEC main computer area.
- BUG FIX: 9-1: Moving slightly to the right in the same TEC main area gives off the message: "There are many buttons. I've Pressed some of them but nothing happens", locking the game up.
- BUG FIX: 6-6 and 6-2 levels lock the game up right when it appears in.
- BUG FIX: Dying in 1-B doesn't make the level scroll anymore (actually it happens when you lose a life AFTER reaching the area that makes the scrolling stop. By returning to the starting area, the scroll wasnt restarting).
- BUG FIX: Talking to Luigi at the end causing the game to glitch and everything disappears if you say yes to reading the letter he has
- BUG FIX: 6-1 Tanning Machine scene wasnt working

- Glitch Fix: The princess was falling through the floor when entering exit doors, like in 1-1, when the camera is zoomed in.
- Glitch Fix: Buttons were still making the princess (and her stage area) lose focus for keyboard presses when touching certain buttons, making the player think the keyboard was not responding anymore. The partial fix was to just click anywhere in the screen before pressing keys. Now this is not more needed. (Tech info: FocusEvent)

Update 3.0a4 (29th February 2016) 
- Adjustments to level->level change algorithms.
- Added Toadella talk. Now the princess can talk a bit with her to discover what she has to say in a given day in the castle, aside of the classic bath, of course. You might be surprised you might not hear a given info from her until days and days later.
- Improvement to Achievement screen.
- The Princess will now walk a bit faster when drunk, avoiding situations she will lose a life or even fall because she is too slow.
- KEYBOARD 2 (SINGLE RIGHT HAND) changes: 'H' for 'Next Scene'/'Enter in Level' and SPACE to Jump. Compliant with AZERTY and QWERTZ
- KEYBOARD 4 (SINGLE LEFT HAND) changes: 'SHIFT' to RUN and Y for 'Next Scene'/'Enter in Level'. SPACE to Jump. Compliant with AZERTY and QWERTZ

- Glitch Fix: when you talked with the guy in the bunker, the text bubbles appeared with no text.
- Glitch Fix: Annoying bobomb 'bwee bwee' yelling in certain areas. I have to check if there arent others with the same problem.
- Many smaller glitch fixes.

- ANNOYING BUG FIXED (so far) regarding WATERFALL sounds being looped endlessly.
- In the gallery, the title 'Peach's Dirty Gallery' was changed to 'Princess' Untold Gallery', as we can play with other princesses, and the game is now evolving even more with the 'PUT' theme ('put' something in her xxx, 'put' it in, 'put' it out...) and 'Untold' (things she would never tell people normally).

Update 3.0a2 - MIM PUT AS3 VERSION (FULLY CONVERTED!) - Official startup version at 20th February 2016.
- NEW: Game entirely converted (lets say REMADE) to AS3 (I did it!) More performance, less bugs, more feature possibilities! It still may contain bugs due to the recoding itself, to be fixed over time.
- NEW 'Error Screen'. There is a black area with red text, DEBUG text ON, and a text messge area (stack trace) of the error, so people can take prints to help to solve the problem earlier. But some bugs may still just 'lock the game up'.
- NEW (internal): Keyboard events in its own class (the player wont notice anything different in the game). Thanks to Overlord5!
- NEW CAMERA (version 3.0m) using a better matrix + trigonometry. Smoother zoom modes and an entirely new Boundary checking. 
- The spaceship in Egadd's lab has more effects (the door closes and thrusters get activated upon leaving Earth).
- Eagle doors can 'fall in love' (hearted eye) if the princess is nearby with some ar all of her dirty bits exposed.
- YET ANOTHER 'frameskip' code. You can find 'Stationary Camera' mode in the options menu. Its even faster than frameskip and people dont need to be crazy using frameskips which makes the camera acts like a very slow FPS shooter game. It will still move but only if the princess is near the boundaries of the current view! Its a YES/NO. NO as default.
- Lactate button changed to 'B' due to conflicts with SHIFT. Load game shortcut is shift+1,2,3,4 since Update 2.3.14 (14th April 2015). When in keyboard mode 3, SHIFT wasnt working for quick load since you will be using this key to SKIP scenes.
- Its now possible to click in the princess during the scene (actually the group of creatures involved in a given scene, like Princess with a goomba, then Princess with Thwomp, etc). By clicking anywhere of those creatures, the zoom will center in the mouse pointer.

Update 2.4.11 (15th December 2015) - IN PROGRESS
- NEW: Toadsworth can ask the princess to show her boobs to him in his bedroom. (this wont happen everytime. You may need to visit the castle more often).
- CHANGED: You have to press SPACE to use the 'level circle holes' in the worldmap, NO MATTER the Keyboard settings. This avoids problems like running while pressing SHIFT (LEFT HANDED) then using a wrong hole.
- BUG FIX: Some fish (like cheep cheeps) going out of the water, like in level 2-2.
- Small Glitch fixes

Update 2.4.10 (5th December 2015)
- NEW: Osama may give other escuses of why he is bottomless, and he may ask the princess to show her boobs to him.
- IMPROVED 'Peach Cobrat Achievement' picture. She now has a cute asshole (erhm...) and her panties will not be there if the player sees the picture while bottomless or naked
- Rule changed: In HARD game mode, the princess WONT masturbate by herself, even if being nymph. Also, thwomps will stomp 30% to 50% faster. Creatures has a 20 to 30% chance of coming in siblings (e.g. 2 goombas instead of one). Also, creatures will fuck her in RANDOM scenes, so a vaginal one might appear first in some creatures, or a gang bang! Certain creatures still dont support randomness.
- Rule changed: random enemies in HARD game mode that appear in the ground WONT be 'acquatic' ones (like cheeps and bossbasses), they MAY appear if inside water. Also, known friends like Poochy and MIPS wont appear anymore in random areas.
- NEW: In 6-6 (Kerhaul Key), the player can try to get past the skull rocks without sex or blowjobs. But the skull door might ask her to do something in return...
- NEW: Now the princess can 'Flash her Boobs'. Only used in rare cases yet.
- NEW: Added a dialogue in the 'skull door' (level 6-6) in order to aid the player to unlock it.
- Glitch FIX: The princess was not 'bouncing up' when stomping Chucks (football players) and Lakitus (koopas in a cloud)
- Glitch FIX: Big and 1up mushrooms deactivating Frog powerup features
- Glitch FIX: 'Min Boobs' and 'Max Boobs' settings not being held (sometimes the princess was getting a bigger boob than maximum, for example).
- Glitch FIX: Lumas and Cheeps always making her boob decrease in the end of the scene, even if not sucking her boobs directly.
- BUG FIX: Player getting stuck after returning to the worldmap 7 green pipe (near the green toad house).
- BUG FIX: The princess with two hair/ponytail when returning from crouching and in certain backside and side views.
- BUG FIX: The princess was still not being able to get past the skull rocks in certain cases.
- BUG FIX: The princess was not going to the prison when losing all lives
- Glitch Fix (MORE TESTS NEEDED): In rare cases, the princess may lose the key if she loses a life right after beating the Koopaling and leaving the airship. 
- Some other small glitch fixes

Update 2.4.9 (5th October 2015)
- NEW: When in character select screen, you can go back to the main screen (in case you want to load a given game, or change the difficulty).
- NEW: Charlieton can sell the Wedding Dress for the princess. It costs 150 coins and it may appear if the princess has finished the game at least once. But sometimes Charlieton can still sell the Lingerie pack in certain days.
- NEW: Charlieton will now advise the princess if the item she bought (like the Lingerie Pack, Fire Dress or Wedding Dress) has a free space in her inventory. If not, the princess wont buy it!
- NEW: Princess Peach in 'Virginity Lost' screen can appear without lingerie (naked!) with a different expression.
- Internal: Cross AS3->AS2 good practises to our AS2 version thanks for advanced REGEX for wrong call names (less bugs). An example: The function 'PES(this,"mouth","eyeLeft","eyeRight") was being called wrongly sometimes as 'PES("mouth","eyeLeft","eyeRight") since Blargh times. REGEX fixed this and detected problems with EndingsGallery too. I hope bugs will happen far less frequently from now.
- IMPROVED OPTION: 'During Scenes...' : LOOP until PRESS (default), LOOP 2x then NEXT (no need to press SPACE/SHIFT), and SPEEDY NEXT (also no presses). There are certain scenes those dont work, or they shouldnt work, so please ACTIVATE OPTION 1 again if you dont pass a given level or a given scene appears locked. Thats because of certain complex scenes. You can tell me which one might be erratic.
- Moved a Blooper/Squid in 6-5 level, easing the area for those who are playing a virgin run.
- Added 'Current Points' to the 'Coinage ending screen' in order to check your current score points, so you can be sure Bowser scenes SHOULD be unlocked if you get past 500,000.
- A better 'blood splat' positioning to Rosalina in 'Virginity Lost' screen.
- BUG FIX: Certain walking shyguys not being hit by fireballs.
- Glitch Fix: Krystal not getting many clothes while in the Gallery.
- Glitch Fix: Custom powerup options not being saved (in outfit screen). Remember that those arent saved per slot, but as a global game config.
- Glitch Fix: Toad Scenes '4' and '11' (laid while face down, and laid while face up) advancing the scene automatically when penetrated (no loops) even with 'During Scenes'... option NOT in auto advance.
- Glitch Fix: Brawl dress bra was corrupted (it disappeared from Princess' chest!)
- Glitch Fix: Inventory acting wonky (e.g. when keeping a Dress, it was going to slot 1. By using it then taking another, it was going to slot2. It would end up fulfilled (slot 5) while trying to fill in slot 6 (non existant).
- Glitch Fix: problems with 'Keep Playing' and 'The End' button.
- Glitch Fix: Raccoon Princess 'spinning/flapping tail' if she falls just a bit. That made harder to jump on irregular surfaces like mushroom roofs.
- Glitch Fix: Flashing nails and toe nails.
- Glitch Fix: BossBass 'Vore' art was misaligned.
- Tons of cosmetic changes and fixes.

Update 2.4.8 (20th September 2015) - SERVICE UPDATE (MORE fixes!)
*(WARNING, this update WILL break your old saved games if you were using 2.4.7 of less!)*
*(WARNING, several bugs fixed, but this might have broken some objects. I have the backups, so please tell me if something is strange, like incomplete clouds, doors without knobs, or animations that are trembling/interrupting (not being smoothly).

- NEW: Added Yoshi Egg in a golden Block in level 4-3 and 7-2!
- NEW: The Toad has a chance to slip his dick into princess' pussy in FOUR SCENES! ('Teasing your Butt', 'Teasing you More', 'Teasing your even More' and 'Tease My Pussy, don't slip!'), provided she was teased by later toad scenes during levels (probably when she already loses the virginity with one first), NOT DURING DIALOGUE NUMBERS, so be careful when touching one when horny! In HARD game mode, the chance is higher, and she can get to it without having to lose her virginity first!
- NEW button code system (the player may not notice anything different in the appearance). Also, in the worldmap, it wont appear 'Press UP' anymore, like with Mario in the worldmap, since the princess goes UP when pressing that key. You have to press the button with the mouse.
- New Rule: in HARD game mode, CERTAIN powerups (like '!' golden blocks) will spurt poisons instead of raccoon power (50% chance). 
- New Rule: now, when the princess finishes the game at least once, ALL Koopalings (Bosses) will be unlocked.
- Added 'Click or Press UP to TURN ON/OFF' in her bedroom switch.
- Improved Inventory! Now the lingerie options chosen (like black gloves) from Charlieton will be UNICQUE per inventory item! The custom lingerie colors/styles set by the player will be kept (in the outfit room).- Mario Gallery could be unlocked easier (like when playing with him in the last world he is) as the player needed to see all of his scenes right in the train prologue toi unlock it properly (a very hard way to unlock it all). Further in the development stage, Mario would be saved in the end, so some new scenes could be seen there (and those would be counted to unlock the gallery). 
- Changed Mario lock hint in the gallery from "Save him and play with him" to "Go save your lover! Mamma mia!".
- Toadette can be without her shirt in certain situations.
- The masturbating toad in the Toadella's bath in her castle was moved a tad to the right (in order not to interefe with other toad dialogues).
- Several changes to save/load game code. This will improve consistency, but you have to restart the game from the beginning in order to use the new save system!
- RESTORED several Princess expressions during enemy scenes (problems since version 2.4.3)
- BUG FIX: When hit, Morton was being invencible for some seconds, but after wearing off, he was still invencible until walking for a bit
- BUG FIX: Princess getting frozen after drinking the pirate mug.
- BUG FIX: The princess was falling through the floor in a underground room in 3-2.
- BUG FIX: 'CONGRATULATIONS' screen was not clickable anymore.
- BUG FIX: Donut Platforms NOT returning to their original position when the princess loses a life.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was going to the prison (game over level) after special levels like the Bonus Toad House, even with 0 lives (which is NOT a game over yet).
- Glitch Fix: "Click to Save the Game" not appearing in the left area of Congratulations screen
- Glitch Fix: 'Back/Forward' buttons in ENDING scene 1 (SMB1) not appearing correctly
- Glitch Fix: Shyguy scene 3 with inverted balloons
- Glitch Fix: Blooper scene 3 was ending with the Blooper laying in the water while semi transparent (instead of disappearing forever).
- Glitch Fix: Sometimes, the diary icon in the HUD couldnt be opened, even just after the scene who makes it appear in Princess's face.
- Glitch Fix: when the Princess was in the "Toad: GRAB THE COIN" scene, the Text Balloon was way over to the Left.
- Glitch Fix: A box appearing more than once in Peach's Castle: "What's that? (SIGH). Thats shameful!! Pictures of me...doing ...those things? WHO DID THIS ? (PRESS SPACE)". This box should appear only once.
- Glitch Fix: Phantos not following the princess anymore (tech info: After modular functions made to him, it was 'gotoAndPlaying tremble' instead of 'gotoAndStop').
- Glitch Fix: Princess' vest overlapping her breasts in SWIMMING and DRIFTING poses (more evident with Tigeress outfit)
- Glitch Fix: Krystal without a body when removing clothes.
- Glitch Fix: certain Buzzy Beetles not falling down.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was not being able to talk to Mario while in the train (due to the chair code being too broad).
- Glitch Fix: Fireballs not killing Flurries, Pokeys and certain enemies right when shooting next to them (tech info: cant use !n and n broadly. Created it just to wrap globalToLocal and dist_x and y directly).
- Glitch Fix: Buttons 'Sound, Text and Background' werent clickable in the main gallery screen (only when entering into a creature gallery).
- Glitch Fix: When the princess is in the "Toad Grab the coin then screw her! Scene", the Text Balloon is Empty.
- Glitch Fix: Piranha plants not centering the screen during scenes (making it hard to read the text balloons)
- Glitch Fix: When the princess is with Toadsworth and you choose 'mastubating' options, her Horny Bar doesn't Increase.
- Glitch Fix: Bobombs not taking the princess into a scene after being thrown by the princess before, then it just explodes.
- Cosmetic changes, like 'Walking like that will let all the Goombas go Crazy for sure!' in the first Toad in 1-1 level, and fixed a typo: "What did you come from", when the princess masturbates in the pipe and someone licks her!

Update 2.4.7 (4th September 2015) - SERVICE UPDATE (huge fixes!)
- NEW Princess subscene in her bath. If she is rubbing her butt with soap, she can 'put her hand down there' sometimes.
- NEW: Now Yoshi can swallow (gulp) certain creatures like enemies and even birds, butterflies and fruits! If he swallows koopa shells, he will spit fireballs, like SMW! He can also 'get inflated' (fat) if he eats more than 5 items! However, since we dont have yellow blocks with eggs that turns into Yoshis scattered along levels, we don't see Yoshi often. However, you can check the new feature in Yoshi House level. If the princess is horny there, koopas (turtles) will come from hog holes and you can use Yoshi to swallow them (attack key)! The same with level 4-4, where a spare yoshi might be found!
- NEW: HARD game mode. Enemies are faster, they 'get exclamated' faster (! icon in their heads) following the princess longer, her invulnerability is almost non existant when attacked, and certain enemies in levels are changed to tougher ones (e.g. A level where goombas are common may not have only goombas anymore). The princess cant masturbate or lactate by her own (she would do that automatically in certain circunstances however). Also, Fire Princess will throw fewer fireballs. More features later.
- NEW: Gourmet Guy scene 2 (Food Fetish). The Gourmet can also 'attack' her if she is bottomless (her dirty bits are exposed) when next to him for some seconds. The player can also choose this scene directly ('go to the table'), during dialogues.
- NEW: The princess can 'peep' through the door in her bedroom and detect if someone is there, like Toadsworth, so she wont be embarrassed by going out of her room. This was made for people who want to avoid her writing in her diary. Remember she can also avoid that encounter by using the sewers in her bathroom area anyway.
- NEW: The princess can 'slide' left and right while falling in the Osama Palace (by pressing LEFT/RIGHT keys) to avoid his scene. This can also avoid her from writing in her diary, as Osama wont make her cum.
- NEW: If the princess is horny, she will masturbate during dialogues (like when she covers herself and talk to a creature).
- Rule change: Now, 4 seated toads are required to activate the 'eat YOU' scene in her royal table. Thats because there are certain subscenes where 4 toads appear in, so its strange to have only 3 seated toads, then 4 of them in the scene. Just revisit the castle more often in order to catch all of them seated in.
- Added a torch to the Peach's big statue in her castle.
- Changed 'Cabinet' to 'Closet' (her pink closet), because the princess was referring to 'my cabinet'.
- More eye expressions in her bath scene
- BUG FIX: Shyguys without gravity (they werent falling down).
- BUG FIX: Princess getting invisible with 'standing' goombas in Goomba Village (Tech info: missing obj.once in goomba code. CheckScene code uses goto 1, then goto F in order to refresh).
- BUG FIX: Huge breaking BUG when the princess was getting the key in the desert levels (activating Phantos). 
- BUG FIX: Huge breaking BUG when the princess approached certain bobombs (tech info: checkGravity still needs 'char'. NoChar only in the future).
- Glitch Fix: Sometimes the Blue Bottles in the Tavern no longer made the princess dizzy again (she was dizzy before in the level).
- Glitch Fix: When the princess was in the Scene with the Creature in the Pipes you can't Read everything the princess says in the Text Balloon because the Text Balloon is too high.
- Glitch Fix: There was no cum on the princess after the Finale Scene with the Goomba's.
- Glitch Fix: When the princess is in the Frontal Scene With Koopa Troopa, it looks like the Koopa Troopa Dick was just Rubbing on her Belly Instead of actually Penetrating her.
- Glitch Fix: adjusted Peach's dish in her royal table because it was hard to interact with the masturbating toad.
- Glitch Fix: When the princess was laying in her Bath, her eyes had been open even though she was sleeping.

- Glitch Fix: a '\' character in Princess' text balloon when she was getting licked by a goomba in the pipe/holes during masturbation.
- Glitch Fix: the locker door not closing in Peach's Castle (infirmary). Tech info: Two lockers, if too nearby to one another, can interefere with each other's code. Either they need to be more far away, or one of them must be locked.
- Glitch Fix: wrong catsuit tail in Tigeress outfit.
- Glitch Fix: strange brown thigh when the princess is in 'backside perspective' as a Catsuit (like in the outfit room)
- Glitch Fix: her dirty dish in the royal table was disappearing when she sat in her royal throne to eat.

- Glitch Fix: a red mushroom not being eaten in the bonus area of 1-2 level.
- Glitch Fix: yoshi costume with a raccoon tail.
- Glitch Fix: A small quick scene when the princess was cleaning her ass in the shower ('Ass Side button'). Her hands was going to her belly from time to time.
- Cosmetic changes, like 'Peach' button text changed to 'Princess' in the gallery, and more text in order to understand that the Toad (in the 'Play with her asshole' scene), as he is trying to say 'ready to be used', but he almost said 'fucked'. Also, added an 'a' in 'I am a Virgin' in the dildo scene in her bedroom. Fixed some 'pussy flesh' appearing in certain toadsworth scenes and 'morning reliever' dildo scnee in her bedroom.

Update 2.4.6 (3rd August 2015) 
- Added Thwomp and Chomp Achievements (and their descriptive texts). Art and text by TripFlip the Great!

- Added 'changeable environments' in Peach's castle. It could be night, day, or cloudy.
- Added legs/feet to the Bobomb Buddies that were watching in the Rawk Ring (level 7-5).
- BUG FIX: Fireballs/Veggies/Starman not attacking Birdoes, Chomp and the Koopalings, freezing them instead (tech info: it occurred after externalization of functions and the add-on of 'if not mutex' after 'mutextimer'. MutexTimer MUST come after, not before).
- Glitch Fix: 'Whore' and 'Virgin' endings not being unlocked in the end of the game.
- Glitch Fix: Some enemies not able to be stomped (the princess was jumping on them with no effect).
- Glitch Fix: Backward words (inverted text) in Monty Mole, Rock scenes (in level 7-7) and certain shyguys. For them, after fixing it up, it still was occurring in scene 1. (Tech info: very strange behavior only in that scene. Used 'forceFlipBalloon' strategy on it).

- Glitch Fix: Princess letting her eyes opened for a bit while sleeping in the Bed scene (beginning of the game) and in some other beds.
- Glitch Fix: Princess walking like she was still grabbing her skirt when naked. Taking other powerups werent fixing it.
- Glitch Fix: The princess can invite the Toads to eat the pizza (then have a scene with them) but it says 'Not enough Toad Creatures wanting to eat', even though there are Plenty of Toads wanting to eat.
- Glitch Fix: When the princess goes to the Toad Doc to cure her butthole, her intimate parts are missing. (Tech info: as she doesnt have panties yet, her intimate parts need to show when she is using 'skirt/dress like' outfits).
- Glitch Fix: The Water in Toadette's Room is Clipping over the Bucket in Peach's Castle
- Glitch Fix: When in the Outfit Room, Princess Peach's Hair is Flashing, mostly when navigating through her outfits until reaching 'Naked' one.

- NEW: LudWig scene by Blargh! He's in World 5 Airship (also in the gallery!) 
- NEW: Piranha scene 4 (Frontal Lick!)
- NEW: ShyGuy Village level! The princess needs to visit the Worldmap of World 3 in certain days to see a new 'Level Hole', then access it! You can also access it in the LOAD GAME (if cheating is on). A toad in the end of certain levels can tell you how to go there faster (like in level 3-4).
- NEW: Shygirl Character for the princess to meet with (in ShyGuy Village level).
- NEW: Gourmet Guy (Huge Shyguy) in ShyGuy Village Level! No scenes yet.
- NEW: Shyguy sounds! They can also 'meow' when seeing the princess as a Shygirl. Her feet will also sound like a shyguy walking.

- NEW: Princess pose ('butt behind') in the Outfit Room screen (showroom mirror).
- NEW: You can change her pussy hair in the options (if Peach/Fire Peach/Tanned/PS Peach): normal, shaved or hairy!
- NEW: you can change her AssHole state (in the Options): 'AUTO', 'Closed' or 'Swollen'. For example, by selecting 'Swollen', you dont need to make her fuck something before getting a gaping hole, as she will be like that all the time.
- NEW: 'Locked in the Flag Pole' scene (if the princess touches the tip of the pole when jumping/falling). Also, she wont get her ass fucked if ALLOW ANAL is OFF.
- Added Yoshi House, Goomba Land and Shyguy Village in Load Screen (quick access buttons) if cheats are on.
- Sound/Music ON/OFF settings will now be saved immediatelly when using '/' key in the keypad, or by clicking the Sound button in the gallery or in the bottom-right area of the screen during gameplay.
- Better expressions when she is walking decently (the new 'confident walking' made by Biles). 
- Now, Wigglers will be enraged (red color) if the princess stomps each one in the first time. The second time will knock him out.
- Improvement of some vases in 3-2, and a NEW vase bonus area in 3-3 (tech info: Now I can place vases right in Level, not Level->Ground).
- Now the player can press 'DOWN' key to make the princess enter 'foreground' doors, like in 7-5 level.
- Removed all 'Peach' references in Lemmy scene (because we can be playing with another princess instead!)
- BUG FIX: Duplicated princess if she gets a dialogue asking if she can put the key in her ass in a ladder, then she accepts it but a nearby enemy takes her during the process!
- BUG FIX: By using the beginning Eagle Door to return to worldmap (from some levels like 3-2), the current level hole in worldmap is getting disabled, like the princess now need to finish the former level again!
- Glitch Fix: wrong princess expressions during Toadella scene (in the underground Bath of her castle).
- Glitch Fix: When Phanto gets the princess while carrying a key in her hands, she tosses/threw it out, but Phanto still thinks she has a key, chasing her all the time.
- Glitch Fix: In some chairs in the train scene, when seating down, then pressing '1' to Leave, a messagebox was showing '2) Sit down', without disappearing and doing nothing.
- Glitch Fix: Some shyguys weren't jumping anymore, like the second one in 3-2 level and the blue one in the main door of 3-6.
- Glitch Fix: Princess not starting the game with the saved belly size. Player had to go to the options screen then leave it to 'refresh' the belly.
- Glitch Fix: Rosalina (in backside view) showing up Princess's ponytail.
- Glitch Fix (NEED MORE TESTS): Duplicated Princess during 'Sleepy Goomba' scene, which could happen more if the player goes to Pause Menu, then return from it. Tested in Level 1-1.
- Glitch Fix: Camera not getting aligned after going out of pause menu when touching the RIGHT WALL in the the end of certain rooms or blocks (boundary of level).
- Cosmestic, small glitch fixes and inner changes: Fixed up some diary pages still with improper carriage returns. Added 'furnace/chimney smoke' in certain houses, improved eye Code, Refactor of peachUpdateDress/applyOutfit, add of 'enemy' and 'friend' in 'enemyInstanceAdd(), avoiding renames to enemy_0 format '.

Update 2.4.4 (12th July 2015) *(WARNING, this update MAY break your old saved games!)*
- NEW: 'Poison' berries (in Toad Forest and some levels of World 3 and World 4). If the princess eats it, she will be highly aroused, she will get dizzy, her belly might increase, and she has a chance to fart after some seconds (a new animation). Remember there's a 'Fart Sound' option, so if OFF, we will only see her awkward and embarrassing pose while poison gases are getting out.
- NEW: 'Lever Machine' in 9-1 (X-naut lab - teleport room) - no scenes yet.
- NEW: Grubba (Reptile from Paper Mario 2) in the game (Ring area of 7-5). No scenes yet.
- NEW: Security guys can take the princess out of the League rooms if he is in and she touches him.
- NEW: Security guys 'handjob (hand stroking dick)' scene.
- NEW: Jolene (secretary toad) in one of the league rooms in 7-5. No scenes yet.
- NEW outfit: ShyGirl (By Myuu). Shyguys will be hornier and will walk faster and they might love her (hearts over them) if the Princess is seen dressed like that.
- NEW stockings color/style: 'White'. The default stocking color is now called 'Cyan'.
- A new Achievement picture (Bobomb Explosion) by TripFlip. It will happen if the princess is 'washed by bobomb explosions' 10 or more times.
- Improved Princess' Brawl Vest (forward view)
- Improved 'Masturbate and Sniffing' scene. Now she will only sniff her finger that went into her asshole if ALLOW ANAL is 'YES' in the options. Also, added more cum.
- Improved Toadette (and other female toads) dialogue logic. Now the princess will be interrupted (with a pink message box) if she touches each of them once at each visit the level with her in. Then she can check other dialogues (if present) by pressing UP or the pink button near her.
- Descriptive texts (sexual plot depicting the art in its pure essence) for Bobomb and Bobomb Explosion ones (button DESCRIBE IT).
- BUG FIX: The princess was getting locked up forever if she walked a bit far away of the skull rocks in 6-6 then press the button to 'talk' with the rock. Also happened after fucking at least two toads before reaching the rocks. She still says "Hmmm...its a skull rock...." but pressing SPACE/SHIFT wasnt  freeing herself up. (tech info: lack of a 'checkDialogKeys' inside 'notice') 
- Glitch FIX: The princess skirt was 'floaring around' in Drybone Scene 6.
- Glitch FIX: The skirt belt of Nurse outfit was not showing up in certain poses.
- Cosmetic changes, like 'Click the Princess' button in the Outfit Room screen (instead of 'Click Peach') and ongoing externalization of functions like climbCode and replaceWParts, diminishing bug risks. Small glitches like 'Krystal pussy' on Rosalina character, in the last of her showroom poses (in the Outfit Room Screen).

Update 2.4.3 (27th June 2015)
- NEW: Poochy scene 2 (sneaky licking). Not in the gallery. For this to happen, the princess needs to be just standing close to him for some seconds.
- NEW: Rawk Hawk (in 7-5 level) can be hit and knocked out (after 5 hits).
- NEW: Rawk Hawk scene (also in the gallery - Bosses)!  If he touches her, Rawk will fuck her with 30% of probability. Otherwise, he will lick her then he might throw her out (hurting her).
- NEW GALLOPING POSE (if using CATSUIT) by Biles. The princess will gallop if she runs (RUN key).
- IMPROVED Princess animations: Walking Decently, Jaunting, Jumping, Tail Attack and Braking - by Biles.
- IMPROVED powerup code.
- IMPROVED The 'play' button in the Boss Gallery
- IMPROVED BODYPART/REPLACE/BASE code (helped from Blargh!)
- Now, when leaving OPTIONS MENU, it will save the current options automatically (no need to have a 'Save Options' button anymore)
- Rule changed: if the princess is performing a Tail Attack, players can now walk or jump immediatelly, freeing her, instead of waiting until her entire rotation.
- Glitch FIX (NEED TESTING!): When using the computer in the bunker, right after airship in 1-7, the princess was going to World 7 instead of World 2.
- Glitch FIX: Boobs in Blooper (Squid) scenes 'Fuck' and 'Flip' not changing size in the gallery, and sometimes the boobs change size frenetically on their own.
- Glitch FIX: When facing the viewer (backside pose), the cat tail was twitching in a quick waggling animation.
- Glitch FIX: Princess with a 'quick different pose' (a 'spark' pose) right when jumping when ready to fly (running with all red arrows).
- Glitch FIX: Lactate button not working correctly in keyboard type 3 (Left Handed)
- Glitch FIX: Cum in her arms (if any) not being loaded in the saved games.
- Glitch FIX: Music volume not being saved

Update 2.4.2 (13th June 2015) 
- NEW: Jinx (the ninja guy from Super Mario RPG, located in Toad Town level) can be found fucking a given friendly character in certain visits.
- NEW Music (Circus from Paper Mario 2 and 'Rawk Ring', both remastered for Level 7-5).
- NEW 'suck' scene in the skull rocks in 6-6. You can select this mode if you want to retain her virginity (if any) and make her fell 'less nasty'. Remember that, if Allow Anal option is 'YES' in the 'fuck' scene, she will get fucked in the ass, so still NO virginity lost (the game will understand she is still pure! Remember that, in an 'ALLOWED ANAL' game, she uses to 'play with her hammerspace' innocently). If Allow Anal is 'NO', she will use her pussy, losing her virginity!
- NEW Krystal portrait face (that appears in the HUD and between levels, once you select Krystal as a playable character) - Made by Myuu.
- NEW: Level 7-5 (MORE AREAS CREATED like the League rooms). You can explore it, but still incomplete. Tons of new art! But no new scenes yet.
- NEW: Security Guys (from Paper Mario 2) in level 7-5. The princess can talk to certain ones.
- NEW feature: The princess can also go to 'foreground doors', those in 'the fourth wall' placement, like in 7-5 level. Just press 'UP' or press the button on each of them to open.
- NEW: Added Blueprint counter in the PAUSE screen. The only way to know the total blueprints will be asking to E.gadd about it (dialogue not made yet).
- NEW option: 'Lingerie can be shred' (ON/OFF). This evolves her garters, gloves, stockings and heels. If OFF, the princess will still lose other clothing parts, though. Beware! She will lose a life if she is only with her lingerie and her horny bar is zero if this is OFF!
- ADDED more detail to her pussy and asshole in the 'fucking Osama' picture.
- Different enemy types can take the princess if time is up instead of 'pokeys most of the time'.
- Rule Change: Now, different Osama pictures will be shown based on her Nymphness instead of boob size.
- REMOVED option: 'Lock Costume'. Since months and months ago, this wasnt working because there isn't any sense in retaining her pink dress, for example, while taking a frog or a raccoon powerup. This would be silly in harder areas, for example (as you would be avoiding the princess to get a tail to fly). If you want to retain the current clothing, just go to her Outfit Screen and set each configurable powerups to be the same outfit/dress.
- Glitch Fix: 'Growing' sounds in certain blocks with powerups and certain cum sounds playing even with SOUND FX OFF. Please inform if sounds still persist (telling us where it happens)
- Glitch Fix: "Left and Right" keys making the princess 'slide left or right', and walking in place in the Worldmap when Acceleration is 'YES' in the options.
- Glitch Fix: "Please notify this to the developer" message in some text balloons with Toads.
- Glitch Fix: 'Shred Bra', 'Belly Min' and 'Belly Max' not being saved (returning to the game was making them default again, even if clicking 'SAVE OPTIONS' before). Actually, they were being saved in the 'SAVE GAME SCREEN instead' (so the player needed to LOAD A GAME SLOT to recover it), which is wrong, as these settings pertain to the OPTIONS SCREEN. They are 'global options' (each save/load game must respect OPTION screen settings for those). So, short answer, now they're GLOBAL options (just save in the options screen and these will be retained in a new gameplay).
- Glitch Fix: In Chuck scene 4 (Back Goal), two pussies were appearing.
- Glitch Fix: "Backside Perspective' (Backward facing) 'Peach PS' hair with a wrong style/color.
- Glitch Fix: Princess not 'standing up' after Jinx scenes 1 and 2 (she was appearing already upright).
- Glitch Fix: Saving as 'ALL MUTED' in the options arent getting loaded when the game starts.
- Glitch Fix: Lakitu with only one scene active (The princess sucking him). Remember he will still START licking the princess, then the second time onwards will be kind of random, so the princess can escape from losing her virginity right away. He still chooses what he want to do with her, so its still possible for him to do the same scene a couple of times (like the sucking scene) then the fucking scene can appear. Also, remember the 'pole' scene (where she sucks then grab the pole) IS another scene per see. You need to make her use it in order to unlock the gallery later.
- Glitch Fix: Princess not 'laying down' to cum after she has an orgasm with an enemy (horny bar at max).
- Glitch Fix: Scroll levels almost not moving to the left if using Camera FrameSkipping feature to diminish CPU usage.
- Glitch Fix: Princess not being able to masturbate herself in the Worldmap, after the first masturbation or after talking to a toad.
- Glitch Fix: Monty Mole scene 2 (in the end) making his body disappear.
- Glitch Fix: Mario endings ("ENDINGS button in the gallery") not getting unlocked after seeing all of the endings once the game is completed.
- BUG FIX (yet to TRY to reproduce it!) In level 1-B, Peach (or any princess) starts in middle of the air.... falling to the void and the player loose a life, then the level restarts from the correct start. This happens everytime the princess enters to this level from Worldmap. I've repositioned her starting position to see if it goes away.
- BUG FIX: In level 2-7 (Daisy Palace), If the current princess talks to Daisy (near her throne) from the right (the princess talking to Daisy while facing left) and choose to help Daisy, the princess disappears.	
- BUG FIX: Princess disappearing after MIPS (The rabbit) scene in the sewers.
- BUG FIX: In Lemmy scene (world 3 airship), Princess was kind of repeating the same suck scene (player has to press space many times to go out).
- BUG FIX: Princess not going to the sky area in Worldmap7 when using the shortcut door area.
- Cosmetic changes (like more delays to 'PANIC RESTART' red text if the game locks up and the princess with more expressions when facing frontside in dialogues for example).

Update 2.4.1 (11th May 2015)
- NEW: Level 7-4 !
- NEW: A friend that can appear in a certain level of World 7 (The princess can talk to him and have a scene!)
- Some new/reworked environment graphics based on Princess Peach for DS.
- Optimized Options Screen placement once more. Replaced 'Peach' references to 'She/Her', as any playable princess will be affected by these options.
- Added a new button in the options: 'She can be a futa'. In progress.
- New 'semen' and 'fucking *slish*' sounds
- Improved the 'view' of the princess'...erhm..intimate parts in a vine scene where there are many leaves, in level 4-4.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was hitting blocks under her with her tail.
- Glitch Fix: Yet another fix to 'Cowgirl/Top' Goomba scene.
- Glitch Fix: Sockhop 'gravity' code freezing the entire game (tech info: checkGravity with non existant char.grav and/or the fact it was being used in a newer variables that doesnt use char)
- Glitch Fix: 'Acceleration' button not working anymore.


Update 2.4 (30th April 2015) - Commemoration of the THIRD year of MIM PUT.
- NEW Level: 7-2 and 7-3.
- NEW: 'Sky' song based on SMB3 (mostly played in sky areas like 7-2 and 7-3)
- NEW: 2 New Achievement Art: Phanto and Peach, AND Cobrat and Peach (by Tripflip!) With the 'Describe' text! Just let Peach get fucked by all of them (all scenes) in order to activate!
- INFO: I tried to deal with the 'white screen' while loading the game ONLINE. The problem is that the game is so huge I am using INSTANCE names in the library to modularize it, but Flash kind of tries to load everything right in frame 1, BEFORE the loader screen (with the 0% to 100% bar). Forums said that we should configure 'Export Frames to Classes' as '2' (or 3, or 4...) then DEACTIVATE 'Export to Frame 2' (or 3, or 4, or..) of everything that use a class instance, but doing this made complex MCs like huge levels, grounds, water, etc NOT BEING LOADED at all (blue screens of death). I rolled the changes back. We have to get used to that white screen. Downloading the game locally doesnt show the white screen anyway.
- Improved Fireball code. Now its identical to Super Mario series (when the princess throws a fireball, it needs to go down IN A DIAGONAL LINE until touching ground, then it bounces up and goes down IN PARABOLIC movement until getting destroyed).
- Improved Cataquack scene (those blue/sand color round things in World 6). Now you just need to press SKIP key (Space or Shift depending on the keyboard layout) if she is facing backside while getting...'eaten')...
- Improved game speed when many golden blocks (tech info: caching and no more 'goto 1' frame all the time).
- Added a way to return to the starting area in 3-3 level (by using the wooden door again).
- Glitch Fix: Monty Moles still frontal facing us after touching ground when appearing from exploded walls.
- Glitch Fix: Koopa shell being green in the current princess' hands instead of red (the grabbed Koopa Turtle was red), and red koopas shell turning green during the throw.
- Glitch Fix: Some of the big stones appeared translucent in the Sewers.
- Glitch Fix: Krystal with no visible cum layers on her thighs/side of her ass.
- Glitch Fix: During quite a few scenes, PS Peach has no eyebrows or eyelashes.
- Glitch Fix: During the first animation loop of Cowgirl/Top with Goomba, the current princess repeatedly moves her arm and dislocates her hand from her wrist.
- Glitch Fix: SockHops not following the current princess while 'exclamating' when he sees her
- Glitch Fix (MORE TESTS NEEDED): 500,000 score points not yet activating the bonus in certain circunstances (tech info: still some _root.score_points instances needed to be changed to FLAGS)
- Glitch Fix: A chomp appearing instead of Chompette in Peach's Castle areas.
- Glitch Fix: Mario, Piranhas and certain Koopalings not getting unlocked in the gallery. Remember that 'Boss' gallery also requires Lady Bow (a green female boo) fucking the princess.
- Glitch Fix: Golden blocks not working (tech info: why did it stop working? Because of externalization of its code, versions ago. 'This' references were detected instead of 'Obj' references).
- Glitch Fix: Toad Doctor scene not happening (in her castle or in levels where he appears in) when she has a swollen ass.
- Glitch Fix: Mario without his legs when he is totally naked (like in certain situations when he appears in Peach's castle bedroom).
- Glitch Fix: 'Shirt Sleeve' of X-naut outfit not showing (tech info: now using _root.checkOutfitLimitGloves(this,"shoulder");)
- Glitch Fix: Some adjusts to the Bumpties (blue penguins) dialogue sizes
- BUG FIX: Level 3-3 crashing when the princess was approaching SockHop (Chomp area). Tech info: strange interference with SockHops code, to be analysed later.

Update 2.3.14 (14th April 2015)
- ADDED: New yoshi type/race: 'light blue'. He might appear at random in the places other yoshis commonly do (like in Toad Town and in his house).
- ADDED: Yoshi can masturbate from time to time, be it naked or not.
- ADDED: 'Auto Save' option (in the Options Screen). It can be 'End of each World', 'End of each Level', or 'NO'. Beware! It will auto save in the LAST USED SLOT (be it a loaded or a saved game). E.g. If you played a game for a bit, then LOADED slot 4, the auto save WILL overwrite slot 4. If you just entered the game (default slot:1) it will auto save to that slot! In order to 'choose the slot', just SAVE it manually (by going to the save screen) or by the HOTKEY (more below), selecting the slot you want, like 'slot 5'. 
- ADDED: Hotkeys for Save (ALT+1 thru ALT+5) and Load (SHIFT+1 thru SHIFT+5). Remember that '+' is not pressed here! Its just to indicate both have to be pressed at the same time!
- ADDED a new 'cannon' subscene (when the princess is going to another world) and those scenes will happen with a certain probability. If a given scene happen, it wont happen again in the same game session (if you leave the game then enter on it again, it will be possible to see it again in future cannon blows). This was done because players were getting annoyed by pressing 'space' (or shift) many times in each use, as the princess used to get butt locked there in 100% of the time.
- Improved 'Option Screen' headers (A thing I wanted to do a year ago, but I was not having the 'eureka' to organize those text better). Now there is more space for new options.
- Improved hog holes (if the princess is horny and near them). Tech Info: enemies must set 'enemyG' and reuse the same. It may fix the 'dead-locked shyguy in 3-3', near Birdo, after many of them leave the vases.
- Improved Cheep cheep code and removed 'instanceAdds', as they must not follow 'garbage collection' algorithms.
- Feature: The title screen may change if the princess is a Nymph at least once.
- Rule change: While the princess is in total darkness, she WONT know what is happening, even if she loses her virginity. She wont describe it well so she WONT write in her diary in these areas. 
- Rule change: Birdo wont be 'breathing' if knocked out. The idea is that she is practically dead. 'Knocked out' enemies are in a way they can't be woken up (EXCEPT for DO OVERS).
- Glitch Fix: Krystal still being able to use the CatSuit (this is NOT possible).
- Glitch Fix: X-naut footsteps not being heard anymore (tech info: SOUNDMC1 didnt exist for default channel 1.)
- Glitch Fix: When selecting Krystal and then going into options to change settings, Krystal's profile pic takes up the first Peach's slot.
- Glitch Fix: Now the princess can only stomp cheep-cheeps (the small fish) if she is really jumping into him (and descending with a bit of speed). 
- Glitch Fix: Chainball (shackles) appearing when crouching, then tapping quickly in the right or left key once (a rare glitch hard to reproduce anyway).
- BUG FIX: Princess appearing in 'dark / shadow' mode after many sex scenes.
- BUG FIX: Birdoes disappearing if many enemies get spawned. THIS CANT OCCUR because Birdo and other special creatures cant get 'garbage collected' when many enemies are spawed due to their special functions. The princess needs them to finish the level, like the purple pearl from Birdoes.
- BUG FIX: Princess locking herself up while walking right or left after using one of the frontal doors in 9-1
- BUG FIX: Chomps not fucking the Princess anymore.
- BUG FIX: Xnauts (and other enemies) still guarding around the 9-1 level, even with TEC-XXX saying 'the corridors are clear'.
- BUG FIX: Piranha plant and thwomp doesnt raising up her laid counter.


Update 2.3.13 (28th March 2015)
- NEW: Added Goombella! And she can appear naked in certain times! She will appear in some areas of World 4 (4-3 and 4-6).
- NEW: Added Krystal Character! She may need some improvements later, and Krystal doesnt like many clothes yet! And she wont be a 'Raccoon' mutant, neither Catsuit nor Tigeress due to her nature and the way the game works! If she tries to 'wear' them, she will be naked! But she can fly if she uses a Raccoon powerup. She still has Peach sounds and some bugs may appear. Her portrait (that appears in the HUD and in the Entering Level screen) is also done (by Myuu!) But no different horny expressions yet. This is a very important achievement because it was so wanted since 2013! So, enjoy her! 
- NEW: A given Samus part is in the game, try to find it!
- NEW: 'Fart Sounds' (YES/NO) in the options. NO as default. The current princess will still fart like in the bathroom (if you press the fart key) but no sound will be heard. Remember she doesnt poo at any means! She just 'farts' air and cum (she can cum from her butt due to the 'horny hammerspace'). But the player can decide his/her fantasy anyway.
- NEW: Yoshi (or any of his friends) can appear stark naked (also without his/her boots). No saddle dick, so no embarrassing moments, but male ones can still fuck the princess and they might be embarrassed due to the fact they are stark naked and they know the current princess character is cute and he can 'do her' any time ;)
- New Shyguy expressions during scenes.
- Added: you might find Toadette getting fucked by a Toad in Peach's castle in certain circunstances (tip: the princess needs to 'play some levels' first. Second tip: it will happen in Toadette's bedroom).
- Now, if 'Dont make scenes require SKIP presses (Auto play scenes)' is YES, all 'different' creatures and even objects will make the scene just happen directly (with no SKIP KEY presses) even if its the FIRST TIME. Most creatures common to the princess (goombas, koopas) still need to keep pressing space only in the FIRST OCCURRENCE of a given scene. E.g. If Peach fucks her 'sofa dildo' while this option is 'YES', the scene will 'auto play' without interference. But if she fucks the 6th goomba (let say its missionary), you have to keep pressing space to change modes in this first appearance. If Peach gets that same scene in the future (or during DO-OVERS), the space wont be needed anymore (only if you set this option as 'NO' or restart the game or dont save the game and return later).
- Jinx is more powerul now.
- Added a new anal action in Jinx Scene 2! 'Allow Anal' needs to be 'YES' in the options, and he will do her ass 50% of the time in each 'scene 2'.
- Added 'Princess sleeping while covering herself'. If she is partially naked and facing frontside to us (covering pose), she might sleep after some time.
- Improved 'exclamation' code for enemies. They're now compliant with 'HARD GAME' mode in the future.
- Rule changed: if the Princess is using Mario Powerup (not just a changed Mario outfit set for a given powerup in the outfit room), she will be able to break those hard brown blocks in one go (instead of two hits).
- Rule changed: certain Boo penetrations might be out of control (that is, we may not control the princess because its a sneak attack!). If you are annoyed by the amount of time the princess is 'locked' in the scene, you can activate 'Auto-play scenes you've seen before' in the options.
- Rule changed: In the skull rocks, you dont need to keep pressing space many times to make the princess 'unattach' from her urge to keep fucking it, like she is locked. Just a couple will suffit. Also, its now compliant with 'Dont make scenes require SKIP presses' option but it will be useless anyway, because you wont be able to fill his blue horny bar on time.
- Info added: 'Press Space/Shift to stand up' when leaving vases, because sometimes the player thinks the game got locked up because he/she cant just press LEFT or RIGHT to leave.
- BUG FIX (TEST NEEDED): Piranha Gallery not getting unlocked.
- Glitch Fix: Creatures appearing visible in the Dark/Shadowy toad room in Toad Town
- Glitch Fix: Princess blushing (Ashamed) graphic not appearing in same situations (tech info: restoreBlush 'else')
- Glitch Fix: 'open palm hand' was showing different hand poses in other characters and styles than Peach default (vanilla).
- Glitch Fix: When getting naked (like taking an apron, or setting her nakedness in any powerup in the outfit screen) she was not appearing with the current set of lingerie (garter, stockings, heels and gloves). But beware that if she gets certain powerups like poison, or losing a life, no lingerie will be with her!
- Cosmetic changes (squareCode and ground/boundary bitmap modes). Perhaps a bit of performance gain was reached in heavy levels like 1-1 itself. And the return of 'Bowser laughing' in the start screen.

Update 2.3.12 (14th March 2015)
- NEW: 7-1 level (its accessible but more features yet to come). Level now called 'Clear Ring' (allusion to clearing).
- NEW: Mario scene (Pole dance). Idea by TripFrip. It will happen 50% of the time, when the princess finishes the game and go back to her castle. This scene will only happen if Mario is in the 'crates' room above Toadella bath. You can also see it in the gallery. (UPDATE: the scene is now complete).
- NEW: New Achievement Art: Anuboo (by Tripflip!) Added the 'Describe' text (also for Shyguy). 
- NEW: Trampoline (spring) from Super Mario Lost Words. You can see it in level 6-4, near the Shrine Tower. You might need to use them in 7-1 once the level is made.
- NEW area of 9-1: 'the ramp entrance'. You need to go to the upper floor (by using two elevators/lifts) and go to the left door.
- NEW: 'Same dialogues if the scene is replayed' OPTION (YES/NO).  OFF is the default. If ON, and the princess is not a nymph, she will always say the same thing (instead of random dialogues).
- NEW: 'Auto Play Scenes' OPTION (YES/NO). OFF as default. If ON, each revisited scene will occur from start to end without interruptions (loops). In other words, if the princess gets in the same creature scene, pressing SPACE (or SHIFT) will not loop it. There are creatures or objects that can already 'go directly' without the first occurrence, and some that arent supported yet, so some might be 'loving the princess so much' making you press space/shift more times to get out of there!
- Improved Peach 'happy mouth' by me!
- Improved camera code once more, fixing the glitch listed in this changelog (tech info: creation of 'checkIfDiffRoomsThenMove()'  and 'set_camera()' in each camera zoom frame type).
- The princess will walk a bit faster when drunk now (she was too slow like in Birdo egg hit, making it very hard to escape Birdo).
- Renamed 3-6 level from 'Warehouse' to 'Wharehouse' (allusion to 'whorehouse' for the horny players and making the princess more worried, or...wanting more)
- Improved an area in Peach's castle (crates room), that will be a place where some new scenes with Mario would happen after saving him.
- BUG FIX: Extra lives in certain levels (like hidden areas of Peach Castle) not appearing anymore (tech info: innerLevelExtraLifeCastle:true wrong, must be innerLevelExtraLifeCastle:false).
- BUG FIX: the princess was not being able to grab the 'flying egg' from Birdo, once she is on it (tech info: obj._type of eggCode CANT be an array due to 'IF more' mechanism).
- BUG FIX: If the princess is riding in the air with her tail (as a Raccoon or 'Leaf Powerup', while descending), she was losing a life after some time.
- BUG FIX: In certian sleeping Goombas, the player starts a sex scene while jumping on him in certain ways, the princess dissapears and the game get stuck.
- BUG FIX: The princess was 'moonwalking' when braking (if 'Acceleration' is ON in the options). 
- BUG FIX: 'Claw scene' (mechanical hands) in E.Gadd lab were not working anymore
- BUG FIX: Enemies inside Dark Toad House (in Toad's Town) not appearing anymore.
- BUG FIX: The Rosalina Spaceship (white one with a red roof) in 9-3 were not working. (Tech info: problem was there since the 'on_action' change)
- Glitch FIX: Diary entries not returning to a saved game state (e.g. the princess was losing virginity event being 'spread' to other saved games where she is still virgin)
- Gllitch FIX: An old camera problem regarding HEIGHT calculation. When going to the menu when the princess was in the bottom of a given area, exiting the screen was making the camera trespass the boundaries (showing up bottomless pits, grounds and objects we are not supposed to see). Tech Info: if Bottom, camera Y-25, so it wont be locked into 'boundary check line hitTest in special case zoom=4'. If Top, Y+25.
- Glitch FIX: Inverted text balloon in Sockhop (green sack) scene
- Glitch FIX: Toads 'last scene' not being saved, so when the current princess was going to a next world or loading a saved game, she needed to fuck all of them again in order to unlock it in the gallery.
- Glitth FIX: Monty Mole with inverted text balloons (once he appeared from some holes, like in 3-6 - 'Wha'rehouse level)
- Glitch FIX: Lemmy Koopaling not being hit by fireballs (beware that Iggy and Ludwig dont support any hit or stomp, just touch them to finish the level).
- Glitch FIX: Starman effect vanishing too quick.
- Glitch FIX: Certain foreground objects flying by in diary screen (if you click in the Diary icon while a wrench g: s is throwing his wrench for example).
- Glitch FIX: Princess Racoon/Tigeress tail will be more hidden between her and Toad Scene 6 now (fuck backside anal), as the tail was poking through his dick.
- Glitch FIX: Inverted text in the last Luma scene in Star Hill level (World 4).
- Glitch FIX: Dicks in certain Peach Art screens. This cant happen, as Peach can't be futa yet. This is a feature for later (that will happen only if FUTA is ON in the options). The player will be able to decide if he/she wants her with that possibility or not.
- Cosmetic fixes, like princess' tail 'a bit under her butt cheeks' in certain poses, streching of the floor and carpet in her closet (Peach Castle). Also, 'externalization' of all 'door' code in 9-1 (this is the process I am doing slowly, in order to make the game more modular, with better maintenance support).

Update 2.3.11 (4th March 2015)
- NEW: New Achievement Art: ShyGuy (by Tripflip!) 
- NEW: Wario in the game! He's in the 6-4 club. But sometimes he's in the bathroom! In certain times, he can appear naked or partially naked! He's not wearing a hat in tribute to JewWario.
- NEW: Wario dialogue, Wario scene 1 ('gimme coins!') and Wario scene 2 (fuck the Princess). Not yet in the gallery.
- NEW: Worldmap 7 (already accessible) with its unicque music. Mario will be there until levels are made. You need to beat the airship of world 6 to access it (or use the cheat then go to the bunker to head to world 7).
- NEW: 'Auto Clean Cum' when leaving showers (YES/NO) in the options. NO as default. If YES, the princess will be totally clean only by stepping by, then exiting the checkpoint showers or the bath, like in her bath (castle), Toadella bath (castle), the bath in 9-1 and in Daisy's bedroom (level 2-7).
- NEW: 'Toads Able to Fuck her immediatelly' (YES/NO) in the options. YES as default. If NO, they wont be fucking her right away, even if she is a nymph, naked, horny or drunk, so you need to talk to them first.
- NEW: 'Belly Button Piercing' (YES/NO) in the 'Outfit Room' screen.
- NEW: Koopas will masturbate if they're close enough to the princess when she is into a lascivious scene.
- NEW princess pose when ending a given level while a nymph and horny. 
- ADDED 'Click here to WRITE all entries' button next to her diary, provided cheats are ON, so the player can see all she could write if she was into lascivious acts with everyone.
- Improved Koopa Graphics (by Biles!). More poses (frontside, backside) to come in a future update.
- Improved/Remade club walls (in 6-4 level)
- BUG FIX: When 'Allow Scroll Levels' is ON (as its by default), going to Airship of World 6 wont make the movement stop in the end pipe, making the princess fall in the void.
- BUG FIX: Certain pipes in worldmaps not working anymore
- BUG FIX: The princess was 'changing clothes and earrings like crazy' when going to the diary icon (in the HUD) in her castle, right after Toadsworth or the first Koopa scenes in the sewers.
- Glitch Fix: 'undefined' name in Airship 6 level.
- Glitch Fix: 'Remaining' scenes in the gallery getting reset in certain levels like Peach's castle, or when finishing up worlds (tech info: EnemyTotal in FOR being 0 in LPeach_Castle mechanism - now erased)
- Glitch Fix: Peach's ponytail in her portrait (in her castle, when you play as Peach and watch the Kamek prologue screen) still appearing as purple, when you play as Fire Peach.
- Glitch Fix: Peach's arms under her boobs in the prologue screen (when she is waking up, but with large boobs).
- Glitch Fix: certain Lumas (like the one looking at right in Bonus Toad House level) making the princess' dialogue balloon far away.
- Glitch Fix: 'Boob size' buttons in OUTFIT ROOM not working.

Update 2.3.10 (20th February 2015)
- NEW: Ninji scene 3!
- NEW: You can return to the former Peach Portrait style (from T. Dirty Monkey), in the options screen!
- NEW: New Achievement Art! Wiggler, Boo and Piranha (by Tripflip!) Peach has to fuck all of their scenes first! Beware, for piranhas you also need to fuck 'piranha-like' creatures, like Nippers (those 'pacman like pink one').
- NEW: Descriptive text for Achievement Art (you can unleash the fantasy of the erotic scene by reading the text - Button 'Describe it' in UPPER-RIGHT corner. Not all pictures have this button (right now, only for Goomba and Wiggler ones).
- NEW: The current princess character can be changed in the OUTFIT ROOM (in the pause menu) if cheats are on.
- NEW: Bowser Throne in Airship 5. Ludwig will use it in his scene later.
- NEW nail style: 'NO NAIL (NONE)'.
- NEW: 'Shred Bra Size' feature in the advanced options menu (click OPTIONS in Character Select screen when starting a new game, or in the Pause menu during a game). You can even set it for the smallest boob size, so our poor princess wont be able to wear any bra :D
- NEW: "Lingerie" Powerup. It will be shown as a pile of lingerie parts with 'Lingerie' text over it. You can find on inside a given toad house in Toad Forest level, or by buying with Charlieton.
- NEW: Charlieton will sell lingerie packs too! For now, he will offer one kind of it (a full lingerie, with stockings, garters, gloves and shoes). No panties supported yet. The player can select the style/color of each one, then Charlieton will give it to her. She can wear it immediatelly (by losing her actual powerup) or she can put in her inventory (if not full)!
- NEW: Charlieton can have some items sold out, so just come again in another day.
- NEW: Catsuit outfit in the game! Thanks for MYUU!
- Two new sound options: 'Replace Boeing sound with Semen sounds' and 'Waterfall ambient sounds' (YES/NO)
- Twelve new Diary entries for the princess (Boo, Shyguy, Bobomb, Blooper, Pokey, Piranha, Wiggler, Chomp and Wrench Guy first scenes, Daisy experience, 'losing her virginity' and 'being a whore/nymph'!) In order to see her writing about her 'whoreness', she REALLY needs to be laid more than 80 times in the whole game'. Thank you TripFlip!
- Now 'Leaf Princess' (nude racoon) can keep dressed if she is using a 'Rosa Dress' or a 'Daisy Dress'.
- Now you can press SPACE (or SHIFT, depending on your key config) to leave her castle bath (when taking a shower).
- Now when you change the garter color of the nurse outfit, that pink one with an hospital icon will be changed.
- Now Charlieton might not appear in certain days in Toad Town. Just return there in another day.
- Improved pussy in 'chicken pose'  (13th pose in the outfit select screen, when you click on her many times).
- Larry/Lemmy/Wendy Koopalings wont fuck her rosebud if Allow Anal is 'NO' in the options.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was appearing right in the pub in 6-4, instead of in the beginning of the level (tech info: poleOnly wrongly set).
- Glitch Fix: Certain garter are not changing color, like the one attached to the stockings.
- Glitch Fix: If we are playing / replaying the game with a character other than Peach, her portrait was appearing with wrong crown (prologue screen, when Kamek appears in). Also, some portraits were missing the parasol.
- Glitch Fix: Morton not penetrating her asshole (in the latest scenes before sleeping), even with Anal on.
- Glitch Fix: Peach with 'tanline' boobs, even without a tanline in the rest of her body.
- Glitch Fix: When pushing "down" + "left" and "right" keys (while the princess is crouching), the shackles (chainballs) was appearing in.
- BUG FIX: Fire Peach having big aureolaes (even if not set big in the options) and a nipple was pink instead of brown.
- BUG FIX: Certain outfits (Striker, Daisy Striker, Yoshi, Shadow Queen, X-naut, Hammer Bro, Frog and Catsuit), if customized in the 'outfit room' screen, was not making the princess naked when getting a Leaf powerup. 
- BUG FIX: Certain galleries STILL not unlocking after saving the game while all scenes are played, then loading the game again.
- BUG FIX: If in outfit room, when pressing ENTER to go to "Panic Screen", then exit to map and enter on level, or just cancel, the princess was acquiring the last selected outfit.
- BUG FIX: Bobombs were not being spurt by certain cannons in airship levels.
- BUG FIX: 'NaN' text appearing in 'Time' area (in the HUD), in Airship levels
- Cosmetic fix and improvements, like a smoother 'princess sleeping animation if she is not moved ', 'internal boob renaming' and externalization of 'buttons' code in the 'Outfit Room' screen, inventory code optimization and adjust in the 'butt' color when Tanned Peach is showing her butt to us (while kneeling).

Update 2.3.9 (2nd February 2015)
- NEW: Flavio scene 1 (in 6-6). Just talk then mock him!
- NEW: Airship 6 (6-7) with a new Koopaling (Iggy). Mario may appear instead of him. No scenes yet!
- NEW: Level 6-6 (Kneeling Key Island)! Its a big level made by me. New textures in the forest area, and a pirate's Grotto. The princess needs to deal with some puzzles to trespass it. More puzzles later. BUGS may appear (as usual) . If so, I'll fix it later.
- NEW feature: 'screwing nuts'. You can see them in some airships. The princess needs to keep jumping in order to make them move! Based on Super Mario Bros 3.
- NEW: Now you can make her remove/drop her current powerup, by clicking in the 'powerup' icon that appears in TOP LEFT of the HUD (if any). The princess needs to be 'free' (not in a given scene) and touching the ground (not falling or flying).
- NEW: 'Protection (Blink)' in the options (if 'NO', the princess wont be invencible when traversing doors, pipes and after being lascivously touched). Great for those who prefer her completelly unprotected (scenes will happen immediatelly). SOME RESIDUAL blinking is still there TO AVOID her losing a life immediatelly if touching hazards, or LOCKED ethernally in nearby enemies and piranha plants, but you may wtill need to keep pressing JUMP key to try to go away or press DEL right after a scene.
- NEW SCENE: 'Skull Rock'. Not yet in the gallery. The princess might need to do it in order to enter the Grotto. She wont lose her virginity, if any. Its compliant with 'Allow Anal OFF' mode. Its in 6-6. (tech info: skull uses varToBeTrue with 'goCum' empty frame for new balloon text changes)
- NEW: The Peach's Diary is now functional! So far, the current princess will write SIX entries according to: 1) The first goomba scene, 2) The first toadworth scene, 3) The first Koopa scene, 4) When she loses her virginity, 5) The Osama 'falling' scene. 6) Osama sex scene. You will notice you unlocked a new entry when there is a message in the top left corner of the screen, and a diary icon is with Peach icon on the right. Once you visit the Diary screen, that icon will disappear, until another new entry is written by her.
- Added a message in the checkpoint shower (now you can press SPACE/SHIFT to go away from it quickly).
- CHANGED: Instead of 'Act as Nymph/Slut', you have now a 'Personality' button: It can be 'She Decides', 'Always Innocent' and 'Always a Nymph'. This will mostly keep her current gait/poses and dialogues (even in Koopaling scenes) but it wont change certain events (like endings). A forced Innocent Princess with more than 80 laids will be still a nymph deep in her heart!) 
- When the princess removes clothes in certain scenes, like in the concotionator room in 9-1 and in 6-6, she will be covering herself after removing it, before pressing SPACE to keep on.
- Improved Butt, AssHole and Pussy for all Princess characters, and a new 'swollen hole' and 'frontal pussy' object. Thanks to DemonChild!
- Improved Goomba scene 12 (cowgirl) with more loops.
- BUG FIX: Wrench Guys ('Aviator Moles' in Airship levels) not getting unlocked in the gallery 
- BUG FIX: 'Peach and Koopa' art were being shown instead of 'Peach and Goomba' after all goomba scenes.
- BUG FIX (MORE TESTS NEEDED): Certain keys still disappearing in world 2 and in 6-6.
- BUG FIX: Achievement screen (right in the start game main menu) showing all pink squares with Peach on it.
- BUG FIX: 'Walking left-right' Nibbles (no AI mode) were not biting the princess' butt (if he touches her)
- BUG FIX: Cannon balls (like in Airship 5) were not appearing, but instead 'playing a repetitive sound'.
- BUG FIX (MORE TESTS NEEDED): Persisting Buzzy Text Balloons being inverted.
- Glitch FIX (MORE TESTS NEEDED): When Thwomp took the princess while she was jumping, the camera were being fixed in the 'air', making the scene not centered in.
- Glitch FIX: When the princess talks to herself (expressions) like when checking out her dress in her closet, her eye was not 'moving'.
- Cosmetic changes, like some improvement to the OPTIONS menu (rearrangement of buttons and text) and text align in Koopa scene 8.

Update 2.3.8 (18th January 2015)
- NEW: X-naut scene 5 by me! Already in the gallery!
- NEW: MIPS (The Rabbit) scene 1 by me! Already in the gallery!
- NEW: Snifit scene 1 by me! It's an anal bead scene. It will appear if he wants to, provided 'Allow Anal' is ON. Added to the gallery.
- NEW: Achievement Art ('Peach and KoopaTroopa' and 'Peach and Goomba') by TripFlip. Peach needs to unlock all Koopa/Goomba scenes in order to earn this medal (you will see a white message saying 'New Achievement!') in the level. If any cheat is used, Peach needs to make another lascivous act with another Koopa before unlocking.
- NEW: Achievement icons: 'Unlock Images', 'Gain Medals', and 'Unlock Images + Medals'.
- NEW Princess pose: 'Laid Down, Butt up' (idea by demonchild!) You can see it in the 'outfit room' screen (click in the standing up the princess to change her poses).
- NEW: "Remaining scenes" in the gallery. Now you can have an idea of the amount of scenes needed to unlock them! Just click in the LOCKED box to see some info in the top left area, along with the informative text below the locker. Some LOCKERS arent supported yet, maybe because they involve other enemy types, ending screens or other puzzles you must find it 'blind-folded'.
- NEW: The princess in the gallery (her character in the right) may change pose depending on her status.
- NEW: 'Funny Dialogue' mode in the options! If its ON, creatures might talk like the princess (phrases like 'Ohhh he doesn't stop cumming!' and 'dont put in my...', etc).
- In the gallery, Shyguys can be exchanged with Snifits (in all scenes).
- Wrench Guy will fuck the princess' pussy in scene 3 (in case 'Allow Anal Sex' is 'NO', that is, OFF).
- Thwomps wont tease the princess from the beginning in each new level anymore. They will fuck her differently at each encounter. Also, his scene 2 will now happen, even if Allow Anal is 'NO' (OFF). The thwomp will spare her rosebud.
- BUG FIX: Toads Gallery unlockable. Now you can unlock it if sufficient scenes. 'DOCTOR', 'REMOVE KEY FROM ASS' and other future scenes that arent easy to find WONT be considered, but once unlocked, you can see them there (its a plus).
- BUG FIX: 'Laid Counter' was increasing in a crazy way in the Lady Bow scene.
- BUG FIX:  Toadette became broken in the train (wrong layer, breakouts).
- BUG FIX (TESTING NEEDED): The princess was disappearing in certain Wrench scenes
- BUG FIX: The princess was being locked up as a statue ('moving left and right while in statue mode') after going to the gallery and playing a given scene before leaving it.
- Glitch FIX: Balloons were not casting random text anymore since the addon of foreground balloons (Update 2.1.8). The RULE is: The princess will say different lascive phrases if she is a nymph or if she is redoing a scene with normal enemies (goombas, koopas, shyguys, bloopers...). 
- Glitch FIX: Toad Image reappearing if the current princess gets licked again in further scenes.
- Glitch FIX: Certain propelers in airship levels, like in world 3, 4, and 5 werent serving as platforms.
- Glitch FIX: If you press CTRL key right when starting a level, the princess stops interacting with enemies and doors (tech info: 'screenLocked' is now avoiding gallery taking over blackscreen mechanism which keeps track of on_action TRUE-->FALSE takedown).
- Glitch FIX: the Princess left butt cheeks was wrong while crouching and swinging it.
- General cosmetic/small changes, like an even more Peach sounds (laughing, arousing, 'noooo' sounds), a fluider dick animation in shyguy scene 1, and position change of goomba scene 8 (frontal fuck).

Update 2.3.7 (9th January 2015)
- NEW: Lemmy Koopaling scene by Blargh!! Its a HUGE scene. He's also in the gallery. Now, Lemmy is in the third Airship, and Ludwig will be in the fifth one.
(Just a reminder: I know many Koopalings still dont walk, jump, hug the current princess, etc. This is for later. The next tasks for them should be a scene for the remaining ones: Ludwig, Iggy - the guy with glasses and a palm-like hair - and Roy.)
- Larry and Lemmy art by TripFlip also added when Peach fuck those Koopalings! Those will be in the achievements, once Peach succeeds!
- NEW: Osama scene 2! (scene 1 is already that one when the princess falls from the sky). You can access it by talking to him. Osama sometimes needs a bit of help to...get a relief.
- NEW: Lady Bow scene (By Blargh!) She is in a Ghost House level. As she is a Boss, you need to unlock all Koopaling scenes (currently 4) in order to see her in the gallery.
- NEW AREA: Inner Castle in Goomba Land level. 
- NEW Enemy: Goomba King (in the castle above). The princess can talk to him. No scenes yet.
- Morton now can RUN towards the princess if he wants to grab her faster! If she is horny enough or a nymph, he will aways RUN to take his 'meat', beware!
- Morton now can MASTURBATE (he wont fuck her if she touches her in this mode),
- Morton wont fuck her asshole if "Allow Anal Sex" is 'NO' in the options.
- Improved Tapestry vector lineart (like those in the Osama Palace, World 1).
- CHANGED: Now, Osama will appear in World 3 palace (where he belongs to). Daisy will appear in her throne (in World 2) if any Princess character (except Daisy herself) is playing the game and reaches the castle. So we can talk to Daisy and she will thank the princess who will try to beat the Boss. If Daisy is playing the game herself, the anchor will already drop!
- CHANGED: Now, in World1, Osama wont be in the palace anymore (there won't be any palace!), as the ruler there is Peach! The airship will now attack her castle instead! So, when the princess finishes up level 1-6, a toad will be in the worldmap, saying to the princess she needs to go to her castle quickly! I will think what the '1-7' will be (Toad Forest might be transferred there, with more features and side quests).
- 'Peril' music will start playing (if BGM is on) in certain situations in Koopaling scenes
- The princess now appears in jumping right when reaching each airship, coming from below it.
- Glitch Fix: An 'ERROR: Notify to the developer' text ballon in Toad Scene 2 (Tech Info: "Are you sure you want me to do this?" was removed because sometimes the princess wanted to do it by herself, so the dialogue was non-sense. But the code was still trying to get that non existent line.
- BUG FIX: (NEEDS MORE TESTING!) Buzzy Beetles are now unlockable in the gallery, if the princess fucks all of their unicque scenes.
- BUG FIX: Some brown breaking and coin blocks not being hit sometimes, and some even returning with coins.
- BUG FIX: The princess was disappearing when masturbating in a pipe (tech info: on_action was being true. It must not. Also because a given enemy can take her during that scene).
- BUG FIX: Situations making Toad Gallery not unlock, even if all scenes were played (remember there are plenty of them: more than 22!)
- Cosmetic improvements/adds, like better Achievement code, better dialogue balloons for the Larry scene, more Morton expressions, a new 'spank' subscene for 'Rinni' toad (in the pink bedroom) and a bit of improvement in the camera when going out of PAUSE screen when the princess is in a left or right side of a given area (like boundaries in the worldmap).

Update 2.3.6 (31th December 2014)
- NEW: Bobomb scene 7 by me. Already in the gallery. (tech info: it features 'varToBeTrue' mechanism, and the 'balloonText being set just before SceneAdvance' making balloons change text when needed)
- NEW: Yux scene 2 by me, idea from tyler_eli. Yuxes now in the gallery ('Other enemies' button).
- Added a new loop in Yux scene 1.
- NEW: Mushroom Frog scene 1! Also in the gallery! (its the small mushroom guy that appears in levels like 3-1). If the princess is horny enough or a nymph, she will take him immediatelly. If not, you can ask for it (when pressing the button or 'UP' key in order to talk to him).
- NEW: Cheep scene 3! It will happen underwater. Not in the gallery yet.
- NEW: 2 Peach and Wendy art by TripFlip! It will show up only if playing with any 'Peach' races, like Tanned Peach, Burn/Fire Peach or Peach PS. Peach has to 'fuck' Wendy to get this screen. The screens might appear by random, so its a 50% chance of seeing a new screen in each new Wendy encounter!
- NEW: 1 Peach and Toad art by TripFlip ('Licking Peach'). You need to let the Toad lick her pussy (two given scenes) in order to see it. Its a later scene (Scene 14 and 21), but you can also see if Toad will lick her earlier, by touching some of them if Peach is horny enough, or in dialogue option 7 ("Let Him Choose").
- NEW: Achievement screen working! "Achievement" button returned to Pause Menu Screen. Now Peach can get *SOME* Achievements, like if she fucked enough goombas, koopas, shyguys, bobombs, and an 'exploding bobomb' achievement. Peach art (when she fucks Wendy, for example) is also added there, so you can review it later. THOSE ARE loaded in a SLOT basis, so each load slot will have a different achievement state!
- NEW Princess pose: 'Bending Backside' (idea by demonchild!) You can see it in the 'outfit room' screen (click in the standing up the princess to change her poses). She is totally exposed in this pose.
- Added 'Inventory (in worldmap') INFO TEXT in Pause Menu Screen, because people are still having problems with the correct key. The key (default Z) will change if you select other keyboard configs.
- Mushroom Frogs will now spurt mushrooms depending on their race: Red ones -> big mushrooms. Purple ones -> poison. The princess needs to be near him and wait for a bit.
- BUG FIX: Certain creatures not loading their 'current fucking scene' situation (tech info: [EnemyAtMax][f] instead of EnemyAtMax[f], lack of Toad_fucking_scene)
- Glitch Fix: A very weird one. The princess was only able to warp from Peach Campus area to 'Levels' area (in Worldmap 1) once. Then she couldnt return until playing a given level first.
- Glitch Fix: The princess' belly will retain the 'minimum' size (set in the options) if she loses a life (provided she is not pregnant, a feature not yet in the game), or if something else happens that decreases her belly. If the player has set a minimum size that is already a big belly, she will retain that size. The same with 'maximum' size. If the player wants her to be with 'just a bit bigger' belly (max size), eating a poison wont make it any bigger.
- Glitch Fix: A given pitfall in level 2-2.
- Glitch Fix: certain 'unlimited' coinboxes when touched by tail attacks or veggies.
- More cosmetic changes and small fixes, like Toad Guards being with a 'normal toad head' (red one) during some frontal facing scenes.

Update 2.3.5 (20th December 2014)
- NEW: Ninji scenes 1 and 2 by me. Its in the gallery ('Other Enemies' button).
- NEW friend: Tadpole (based on Super Mario RPG). They will be present in some levels of World 4 and 6. You can use them as trampolines, and you may be able to talk with some. No scenes yet.
- Added Lakitu to the Gallery!
- New art (Morton and Peach) by TripFlip! You can see it if Peach (or her varieties, like Tanned, PS or Fire Peach) is fucked by Morton in the airship.
- Added 'Peach falling over Osama dirty cum' (if Peach has a boob size 3 or more), and Improved 'Peach falling over Osama' art (re-vectorized) when Peach falls from the sky in World 1.
- Now, the princess can stick the key into her ass if she needs to climb something (like a ladder) but she is carrying the key in her hands.
- Now, Chain Chomps will react to fireballs, veggies and tail attacks (they will be stunned for a bit).
- Now, the princess can enter inside a certain bonus door in 3-1 (if you find a way to go there).
- BUG FIX: Wendy (and sometimes Morton) not getting hit by fireballs.
- BUG FIX: Monty Scene 5 making the princess disappear while the scene doesnt happen.
- BUG FIX: Piranhas and Mario scenes not unlocking their galleries.
- BUG FIX: Footjob scene without the 'blue exit button', making the scene 'locked forever' in the prison.
- BUG FIX: REDO scenes (in an already laid enemy) acting wonky (the player was able to activate it being far from some enemies).
- Glitch FIX: Key 'disappearing' in certain desert levels if FULL SCREEN (tech info: the problem is the THROWN GRAVITY code that 'executes more' when its full screen, due to more CPU usage. But gravity should not execute at all in steady keys, as they're not flying in a parabolic path!)
- Glitch FIX: A chainball appearing with the princess if she crouches (down key), then you release it, then press 'down key' again immediatelly (tech info: PeachPose acting, THEN onEnterFrame forcing gotoAndPlay first frame. "IF" avoiding the execution of PeachPose in the end, while pressing DOWN key again, fixed it).
- Glitch FIX: '500,000' points bonus scene was acting strangely (e.g. it was activating even without having 500,000 points already)
- Glitch FIX: An old one nobody detected before. In all Phanto scenes, he goes away after fucking/playing with her. But then he appeared right where she was, like teleporting.
- Glitch FIX: Certain text balloons were still retaining the last text in certain scenes like x-naut scene 4 and ninji scene 2 (tech info: balloonEngine needs to reset balloonText BEFORE jumping from balloon domain to another balloon domain).
- Glitch FIX: Certain keys being the last key grabbed (sometimes even in former levels). E.g. The princess took the grey key in 2-3. She found a new golden key in 2-5, but when grabbing it, the grey key appeared in the place of the golden one.
- Glitch FIX: Yoshi 'throwing' the princess from his saddle with inverted balloons. Also, when pressing SPACE, the princess was riding it again instead of leaving the scene.
- Glitch: inner music not changing when going to certain places, like in level 2-3 (The Pyramid).
- Added more DEBUG variables (PAGE DOWN key)
- Cosmetic changes and fixes, like cum (and other) sounds during scenes in the gallery being muted in certain situations, and a skirt left in 2 Shyguy scenes and a Chomp one.

Update 2.3.4 (7th December 2014)
- NEW enemy: Ninjis (Art by Biles). No scenes yet, but the princess will be hurt if you touch him. You can pop him out.
- NEW underground area in 3-1. Try to find it.
- NEW object: 'pink pots/mushroom like' objects the current princess can grab and carry around, like SMB2. Mario used to put one pot over the other in order to climb them. You can find those in 3-2 and 3-6.
- NEW friend: Mushroom Frogs. You can find them in 3-1, 3-3 and in rarer areas. No scenes yet.
- NEW mushrooms with a 'trunk' (in certain levels like 3-1 and 3-3). They are adornments (background), and they're dormant.
- NEW: Jabbi scene 2 (idea by BlueVixen, thank you!) Added to the gallery ('Other Enemies' button).
- NEW: A Fleshy dick (that can be seen in the closet scenes sometimes). Also, I improved the double dildo in Wendy Scene from scratch!
- NEW: Princess pose in the Outfit Room Screen (just click on her until you find it out).
- NEW: Tthe princess can grab bobombs from red leaves! He will be ready to blow in up to 6 seconds! You can find some bobombs if you are lucky enough, in any red leaves, or surely in certain areas that it will be always a bobomb, like in the new underground area of 3-1.
- NEW: 'grey misterious phanto' background art in a room in 6-6.
- Improved Peach faces, Rosalina and Daisy (horny bar), art made/improved by Myuu!
- Improved bobomb explosion action.
- BUG FIX: An annoying one, in 1-3 (The princess, even grabbing a key with her hands, was asking the Toad to 'please remove it' -> from her ass).
- BUG FIX: The princess was still climbing up and down the vines while carrying a veggie. As she isnt allowed to do this but with the game glitched, the princess was 'sliding up and downwards in place'.
- BUG FIX: The princess was trespassing cliffs (going to the void) if she was drunk/dizzy (tech info: when bukaked, on_action wasnt being false later).
- BUG FIX: Cataquacks not being able to bounce the princess up when trying to get stomped anymore. Also, when the princess touched Cataquacks, she was getting invencible (tech info: mutex timer not set).
- BUG FIX: The princess' asshole was not getting swollen in certain situations yet
- BUG FIX: The princess was not able to masturbate herself in order to sleep in 9-1 (Xnaut base).
- BUG FIX: The princess was appearing right in the pole dance area in 6-4, instead of the beginning of the level.
- Glitch Fix: Muted Drybone dismantle sound (it was corrupted).
- Cosmetic fixes like her 'right' eye movement to right (it was going too 'upwards' than the left eye). Also, optimized 'check climb' code (n-no n).

Update 2.3.3 (27th November 2014)
- NEW: Monty Mole scene 5 (already added to the gallery).
- NEW: X-naut scene 4 (already added to the gallery).
- NEW: Toad Removing key from her butt (If she has one! - I mean, the key!) For now, only in level 1-3, and if she is a nymph (10+ laids in the same level). The plan is to make more scenes which make her fall in the key, while still embarrassed. Added to the gallery!
- NEW pussy option in her dildo reliever sucker (in her sofa): The princess can be fucked in her pussy now, and if you try to fuck her asshole when 'Allow Anal Sex' is 'NO', the princess will complain.
- NEW area in level 4-4.
- NEW friend: Puny elder. The princess (or other playable character) can talk to her. She's the leader of the Puny race (in Paper Mario 2).
- NEW: Princess nipple types: FLESHY (classic), SLICK and YUMMI (now the default). Based on Playshapes hentai. You can choose its type in the OUTFIT ROOM button (when pressing CTRL to go to the PAUSE SCREEN).
- NEW: Princess' nipples will now be hard (aroused) if she is horny enough or a nymph.
- Added 'Other Enemies' in the gallery, where Jabbi is (so far). Renamed 'Friends' to 'Other Friends'. Those two areas are for those rarer creatures with few scenes (or just one).
- Added a subscene in the train, when you choose 'Click to Play this level': the princess can sit in her chair and you can make her Kiss Mario!
- Added two new Princess poses in the Outfit Room Screen (just click her in the mirror). The last pose (kneeling while facing forward, butt behind) is almost perfect, because there are still some outfits that become weird, like the Striker, but, FOR NOW, thats on purpose. Also, she wont be wearing vests and aprons in this pose, temporarily.
- Added DEBUG MODE (just press PAGE DOWN). It will help me find out bugs. If someone finds a bug and he/she can reproduce it, you can activate DEBUG MODE, then take a screenshoot. I can analyse it better.
- Added attack to Yuxes. If the princess is nearby and he notices her, he will attack!
- Added her scepter in her bedroom (in Peach's castle). It will appear there depending on the day, because the princess herself (or her housemaid toads) will keep it safe in another area we dont know. So if its not there, just revisit the castle more times. No scenes yet.
- Changed 'Character Select' to 'Outfit Room' text in PAUSE SCREEN.
- Now, the princess wont be putting a key in her ass if 'Allow Anal Sex' is 'NO', even being the nymphest girl of the universe!
- Improved Toad Scene 9 ('Frontside Anal Squatting').
- Improved 'multiple' stomp detection algorithm. The princess wont be able to stomp several enemies at once, but one by one. This was already made (tech info: inner mutex) but there were certain cases the mutex didnt work, like touching a Birdo, then exploding an egg, then touching Birdo and/or a shyguy. Some was not even giving a scene to the princess anymore.
- Added a road to Worldmap 3 (connecting level 6 to 7). Some people were still making confusions there (thinking its a glitch), so I decided to always put a path where the princess can walk along.
- Added the FootJob Gloryhole (that occurs in places like the prison) to the Gallery ('Princess button').
- Remake of the rocking chair art (where the toad likes to swing on) like in level 1-1 and in Bonus Toad Houses.
- BUG ATTEMPT FIX: Birdo was spurting her pearl (pink ball) outside the screen, making the princess locked because she cant grab it anymore.
- BUG ATTEMPT FIX: 9-1 (X-naut base): The princess not able to mix the right potions anymore, if she uses a wrong one then try again.
- BUG FIX: Pokey 'one bead' scene making the princess disappear while his head was walking 'in float mode'.
- BUG FIX: Finally the 'goombas not unlocking the gallery' problem is now fixed. If the princess fucks the 15th (or sometimes the 16th goomba), provided the 'ALLOW ANAL SEX' is ON, you will now see them in the gallery!
- Glitch Fix: camera locking up in 'down view' before 'going up' again if the princess is into a sex scene while crouching (DOWN key)
- Glitch Fix: since version 2.2.6, belly sizes were not going to the 'biggest' size. This is now fixed.
- Glitch Fix: Button 'Play' when in a 'game over screen' is now 'Restart game'.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was not expressing herself (idle face) in Cleft scene 1.
- Glitch Fix: Chomps and Poochy not enlarging the princess asshole even with 'Asshole can be swollen' ON (in case she is fucked by their large dicks).
- Glitch Fix: Worldmap 6 music was corrupted.
- Glitch Fix: Multiple fingers in the princess opened hand (like in Bowser scene in the prison), when she was wearing gloves.
- Glitch Fix: The dialogue with Mario was offering 'pop up your cherry', even with a non virgin Princess.
- Glitch Fix: The princess wasnt descending finish poles correctly.
- Small cosmetic add-ons and fixes, like the Toad guard mouths not talking anymore after some dialogues, and green yoshis appearing instead of pink female yoshis. Also, toadette in the train will say different phrases now.

Update 2.3.2 (15th November 2014)
- NEW: FootJob scene in the prison (after a CONTINUE during GAMEOVER). If the Bathroom door is locked, the princess needs to do something to leave the area. Made by YuriNicolau!
- NEW: 'Door Locked dialogue' with 'remove key in the butt' scene! If the princess is carrying a key up her arse, she needs to bend in order to stuck it in the locked target door (like those locked rocky doors in World 2).
- NEW: 'Dildo sucker' scene in her sofa (Peach's Castle). I also improved the dildo. 
- NEW: Jabbi scene 1. Also, more Jabbies can appear in Toad Forest (next to Toad Town) if the princess goes far in world4, then return to her Castle area.
- Added the 'Item feature', but not yet active. The princess will be able to carry ONE thing at a time (its NOT a powerup, key or outfit, but an item, like the scepter, a little box, a dildo...) 
- Added some Buzzy Beetles to inner pipe areas in Worldmap1.
- Added the SWAN scene and the Dildo Sucker in the gallery.
- Improved 'camera zoom' restore once more. Now, the current zoom mode will be retained (and saved automatically to the cache). You dont need to keep pressing '-' key to get the zoom you wanted at every new level.
- Improved 'cant press DELETE to lose a life' code during scenes. This avoids unpredicted situations. If she is talking, in a scene (with or without checkscene), going to doors, etc, you cant make her lose a life.
- Improved text messages regarding the current Princess. If its Daisy, creatures will call her the correct name, for example.
- (TESTING!) Added a sanity check for 'on action' situations where the princess walks around but she can't interact with any enemies or doors. The system will detect that kind of errors and it will fix it.
- Now you can quickly GO to worldmap if something goes wrong (e.g. Peach getting non-responsive) right in THE PANIC screen (ENTER KEY). You dont need to load the latest save or the entire game for this.
- BUG FIX: Boos, Cobrats, Drybones and others were not appearing anymore. (Tech info: 'Exp to Frame 1 must be YES' because I use squareCode now)
- BUG FIX: Strange dick appearing in Chomps instead of his black bulgy one.
- BUG FIX: Phantos stopped following the princess.
- BUG FIX: Multiple keys appearing when Phanto (or other enemies) make you drop the key before sex.
- Glitch Fix (NEEDS TO TEST MORE): Sometimes, certain Piranha scenes were making the princess invulnerable to enemies forever (after the scene), and not entering doors.
- Glitch Fix: Laid goombas with 'blinking toes' in laid scenes.

Update 2.3.1 (9th November 2014)
- NEW: Yellow Rubber Duck Toilet with its scene. You can find it in a given Toad house in Toad Forest, a grassy area in Toad Town level, in level 6-1 and maybe in rarer areas.
- NEW: Monty Mole scene 3 and 4 by me.
- NEW: Bumpty scene 3 by me.
- NEW: Improved Peach image (Lost Virginity screen) as well as Daisy and Rosalina, by using better techniques.
- NEW area: inner of 'Green Toad House' (in Toad Forest). Sometimes it can be unlocked (a given toad might forget to lock it), so the princess can enter inside.
- NEW: A white swan (a cute animal the current princess can mount to). You can find it in the Castle tower (Peach's Castle) and in level 4-3.
- NEW: The princess can grab the key decently now, like the vegetables, if she's not a nymph. If so, she will be so horny she will prefer to put it...you know where. However, the code was not trivial. There are cases the key can disappear. If so, a message will tell you to go back to the worldmap / restart the level, just in case.
- NEW: New Key types (by color). Right now, we have silver, gold and red keys. The plan is to make certain keys do different things on the princess (e.g. red keys will 'keep fucking her asshole by itself' if the princess sticks it there, happenning if she is a nymph. Not yet made!)
- Now a cake might appear in her kitchen only if Zess T bakes it, instead of at random visits. 
- Chuck Scene 4 (anal) will also happen if 'Allow Anal Sex' is 'NO' (in this case, the enemy will cum before stucking in her ass, and the princess can flee).
- Improved camera code with a simplier math function (the player wont notice anything aside of a bit more aligned HUD in every zoom).
- Improved 'Toad Forest' guy in 1-3. His code was remade, and he might do something interesting to her when she returns the key
- Improved 'Princess crouching to stuck the key', with a more 'live' movement.
- Improved Toad Scene 3 (he will push the currnet princess down instead of she willingly getting him)
- Now, Bumpty 'slip to her ass' scene will change to 'slip to her pussy' if 'Allow Anal Sex' is 'NO' in the options.
- BUG FIX: Little fixes to ground areas of 2-5, and fixed a bug that made the camera 'locked' between two areas in the locked door (when the princess goes right then left many times).
- BUG FIX: Piranhas in 1-2 and the second Piranha Plant in 1-3 were not affecting the princess. And fixed one of Piranha scenes (The princess was disappearing, with only the text balloons visible).
- BUG FIX: Bonus area in 1-2 without ground (the princess was falling until losing a life).
- Glitch Fix: If the princess was a nymph and she entered the level without moving, the toad was running up and having a sex scene with her, then the princess was going immediately to the world map.
- Glitch Fix: Inverted Princess feet in 'Frontside goomba scene'. Actually we can 'rotate our feet', but it painful and not everybody can do this at full 90 degress at the sides.
- Glitch Fix: Improvement to 'flying' pose, while stomping an enemy (like Chomps). Now the princess will hit him.
- Cosmetic changes and fixes like the arm and hand of Running Princess Pose, improvement to the yellow duck in her bath.

Update 2.3 - HUGE UPDATE! (27th October 2014)
- NEW: 'Toads sneaky scene' in her bed! Before she asks for Mario in the beginning, Toads were seen playing with her. You can call those toads later, by making her sleep in her bed again during the game. The toads will remove her clothes, if any.
- NEW: Japanese goomba in goomba level (made from scratch, SOME ideas from Gaijin Goomba).
- NEW: The Wiggler that is sit down (like in 4-1) will now fuck the princess if she touches him.
- NEW: Depending on the situation, the large pizza in the royal table of Peach's Castle can let you choose a scene with the toads sit in the table. It requires more than 2 sit toads at the to see it. (tech info: 'creature array' and transfer code that can make scenes more unicque)
- Added message to knocked down Koopalings: "Touch him in order to finish the level", so the player is notified to walk towards him/her in order to leave the ship
- Added 'custom scene' mechanism in an automated way for enemies. For now, it will happen in 'Seated Wigglers'. They wont fuck the princess in all possible scenes, but those who are compatible with his current seated state.
- Added a message: "Press '-' key to change ZOOM" during the scenes (to make the player remember he/she can zoom in/out).
- ADDED the 'pop' state for Cataquacks. They will be knocked down if a POW BLOCK, veggies, fireballs or tail attacks hits them. Jumping wont kill him, this is on purpose.
- ADDED More subscenes for Bowser scene 2 (the 'doggie sex')
- ADDED Eye expressions for Bowser (all scenes)
- Added 'Princess looking steadily while showing her tongue', in frontside mode (by pressing LEFT and RIGHT buttons) if she is a nymph.
- Improved 'Peach in the bed saying: Mario?' cut scene animation. She moves more naturally now.
- Improved 'creature engine placeholder' code (CEP). The player wont notice anything different aside of a slight CPU speed (maybe 1FPS) and maybe less than half a second improvement while loading a level. Thats because the starting position of enemies wont be 'activated' until the princess is near. This also fixes some glitches like Birdoes and Boos being so far away like they 'walked' by themselves even the princess being miles away from them. No more! But the main reason for it to be great is the placement of creatures being a lot faster for me when making new levels from scratch or when putting/removing enemies in a given level. Moreover, I can make certain enemies appear in the beginning according to the princess status, if she is continuing a GAME OVER, or if she is playing the game again (she finished it at least once). So a koopa can appear instead of a goomba in a more easy way. Finally, game compilation times decreased by 20%!
- in Peach's Castle, more scenes for 'Princess sitting down in her royal table', when pressing 'number 4', and you can force her to masturbate (number 3), even if not horny or a nymph.
- Now, the cum puddles won't be the same object. Some can have more cum than the others.
- Now, the QUALITY setting will be saved automatically (to the save file) if you press the shortcut key to change it ('=' key)
- In 4-4, the red prison will now open the door if you knock the xnauts down, letting the Toad free and interactable (you know what I mean).
- Glitch Fix: Game screens (like the princess waking up in her bed and her castle) are now correctly placed (there were cases you can see areas you should not see, like incomplete textures). Tech info: depth in 'once' mechanism in frame 1 inside screen.
- Glitch Fix: When the princess went into Toadsworth's room, and the scene finishes, her text bubble is staying there from the final words she says: 'I just came...never mind.'
- Glitch Fix: Bobomb 'double' scene still making the princess say 'oh my pussy' even if fucking her ass (in the case the fucks this scene again or she is a nymph).
- Glitch Fix: 'Game Quality' button set to 'HIGH' even if not HIGH in the advanced options. 
- Grammar Fix: Toadsworth scene 1: 'To me' changed to 'Really...me?' in the princess dialogue text.
- Grammar Fix: After fist Toadsworth scene 1: 'What I have done' changed to 'What have I just agreed to???'
- Grammar Fix: Bobomb buddy: 'The sovereign of each palace might has it' changed to 'The sovereign of each palace might have them'.
- Grammar Fix: 'You dont have any key' changed to 'You dont have a key' in the cannon computer.
- Grammar Fix: the princess will now say 'Ohh, hello, my dear Yoshi!! Do you know where Mario is?'
- Grammar Fix: changed to 'A Goomba has stolen my keys.' and other text with 'key Toad' in 1-3 (former 1-2).
- Grammar Fix: changed to 'Get away from my...' in Osama falling scene. And other grammar fixes.
- BUG FIX: Horny bar not being updated right when the princess is in a new level.
- BUG FIX: When bobomb's dick fucks her pussy, the princess is not being devirgined.
- BUG FIX: The princess was NOT saying dirty things even with 'act as a nymph/slut' turned ON.
- BUG FIX: A text balloon was still appearing for a fraction of a second when the princess crouched while horny, and the text was inverted (strange text).
- BUG FIX: Pokey not being knocked down if using starman.
- BUG FIX: If you had enough coins to buy an 1-up with Charlieton, you could cheat by pressing '1) Yes, Please, 3)Life Mushroom, then repeat'. Now, if you try to buy something while the coins are getting 'dropped', a message will appear in: 'You have to wait the dropping of coins first'
- BUG FIX: Wrong block in the finish pole in World 4 (actually the ice blocks only appear in World 5).
- BUG FIX: In 'The Diamonds' level of World 3, the princess can now access a given grassy platform.
- BUG FIX: X-naut not being popped up when the princess was using starman.
- BUG FIX: In the level 'Flock Paradise'(World5) climbing up the vine, then falling back down caused the princess to fall into nothing, resulting in her death.
- BUG FIX: Bloopers still 'leaving' water areas, mostly when its a small lake or container (e.g. in Marshmallow Mountains level, near the finish pole).
- BUG FIX: E.gadd scene text were inverted.
- BUG FIX: If the current princess touches toadette/Rinni or another female toad with a text balloon, once the princess is far away from them, the balloon disappeared and they werent reappering upon touching them again.
- BUG FIX: When climbing up with HUGE tits, the princess' bare boobs show out on the sides even when they are fully covered, and with nipples (like the boobs were front facing).
- BUG FIX: Horny Bar not being updated in the start of each level (it showed as empty but it is actually in a given level).
- Tons of cosmetic, small grammar problems and other glitches fixed. Thanks to [b]Bluey5[/b] for the help!

Update 2.2.9 (15th October)
- NEW: Buzzy Beetle Scene 4.
- NEW CREATURE: Monty Mole. He will appear in certain levels with grassy or bricky walls, like in 1-3 and many levhas of world 3. 
- NEW: Monty Mole scene 1 and 2. Also in the gallery!
- NEW: Toad Scene 24 (actually a DOCTOR scene). It will happen in nurse room (Peach Castle), provided if the princess has a swollen asshole. Already in the gallery. Certain toads can act as 'fake doctors (quacks)', trying to play with the princess' little hole in certain areas, like in Mario's Pad (if he's there). In this case, the princess doesnt need to haa swollen hole.
- NEW: 'Gape' asshole mode. If the princess is fucked in the ass for certain times (or just once with huge dicks/enemies), she will have a gaping hope from now on. She can only return to normal if she asks a toad (generally a doctor) to ...massage her rosebud.
- Bowser scene 2 added to the gallery. If you finish the game with more than 500,000 points, that scene will be unlocked (it will happen AFTER the bed scene. You have to keep pressing the right pink button). Remember you can see that scene if the princess gets three gameovers.
- New (YES/NO) option: Swollen asshole (for those who dont want big dicks to spoil her rosebud).
- New dungeon area in 6-4, accessible from a given pipe. The princess might find coins, and...some enemies there...
- Now Thwomps will spare her asshole, if 'Allow Anal Sex' is 'NO' in the options.
- Pink Closet scene: Now, the princess will talk differently based on the creature thats inside it.
- Glitch FIX: When the princess enters on doors, her 'blinking red arrows' will be cancelled immediatelly.
- Glitch FIX: Igloos werent giving out Furries if the princess isnt horny (tech info: 'no_horny' not working correctly).
- Glitch FIX: Some enemies still having 'a bit of Parkinson' when seeing the princess (exclamation) then turning right, like those enemies which dont fall (as Chucks, Buzzy Beetles and Monty Moles). Tech Info: 'enemyExclamationEnd' needs obj.exclamation as well (instead of only obj._parent.exclamation) because of direct function calls instead of exclamation object calling it.
- Glitch FIX: Some enemies not allowing do-overs, like Shyguys and Buzzies.
- Glitch FIX: Certain thwomps not initilizing sex.

Update 2.2.8 (7th October 2014)
- NEW: Buzzy Beetle! He can even appear walking upside down, falling if the princess is nearby. He will appear in 1-5 and many levels of World 3.
- NEW: Buzzy Beetle scene 1, 2 and 3! Added to the gallery!
- NEW: Bowser scene 2. To see it, you need to lose lives (get 2 or more gameovers), then keep continuing the game. I'll put in the gallery later, so you have another option instead losing lives: finish the game once (and get the Bowser ending - WHAT IF) in order to unlock it like having 500,000 score points. Bowser scene 1 is still the default one that happens if you finish the game with more than 500,000 points.
- NEW: a different ending pole scene. The princess can climb down in backside mode in certain times (and cum, depending on her horny status), and if she gets in the top pole, something can happen! Whoops!
- NEW: The princess can now enter her pink closet, with scenes! In the future, I can see if its possible to put Toadette walking nearby, so if the closet is closed, she wont notice anything. 
- NEW: More dick varieties that can appear inside the Closet, like 'Lizard green dick'.
- Improvement to cases when the princess falls in the abyss for too long. The system will detect the bad area she got, and she will lose a life and reappear in the latest checkpoint.
- Little optimization to pipes where koopas appears from (better code).
- Added a message for the walking bobomb: 'The bobomb is not horny enough. You can wait for him to be ready!'. So the player will understand why the bobomb is not fucking the princess. Also, if she is a nymph, she will fuck that bobomb, even if not ready!
- Added a 'Koopa leaving shell' and 'Buzzy leaving shell' poses, after being inside a shell for so long
- Improvement to tubes/potion graphics (they're curvier).
- Improvement to her standing and walking poses while being a frog.
- Improvement to ending pole blocks. Depending on the world, the base block will be different. Also, a small glitch fixed (when the princess was masturbating in it, the loop was showing her standing up abruptly, while she was smiling).
- Now the princess will blush, 'cry out' and look left/right if you make her pee in the toilet.
- The princess will say more sentences depending on the clothes in her larger closet.
- Glitch Fix (more tests needed): A dick in a given tree (gloryhole scene) with reversed text balloons.
- Glitch Fix: sometimes, when running and taking a shell (from koopa or buzzies), the red arrows keep increasing like she wasn't grabbing any object, making her run. She must stop running when carrying objects.
- BUG FIX: certain 'trunk pipes', like in 4-2, was making her come up with the invisible bug (locking the game up).
- BUG FIX: Koopas not appearing inside the pipes in the sewers (Peach Castle). 
- BUG FIX: Certain bobomb later scenes or explosions freezing up the princess.
- BUG FIX: The current princess was disappearing when she was horny / nymph / drunk while being taken by a horny toad while he was covering his head with his hands, like in level 1-6!
- BUG FIX: Erratic cheep cheep jumps in certain levels like 1-3 (he was jumping too high sometimes).
- BUG FIX: Duplicated Princess in 'jumping cheep cheep' scenes (outside water) like when she is over the red donuts in 1-3.

Update 2.2.7 (16th September 2014)
- NEW: Level 6-4 and 6-5! (idea by MPLDAM) Thank you!
- NEW scene: VINE. You can find it in levels like 3-3, 4-4 and 6-5. Its NOT a piranha plant scene. The princess needs to 'jump' in certain 'upper plants' to activate it.
- Improved finish pole details (and its now grey), and improved its code
- Improved Cheep collision code: Now he swims until reaching a wall.
- Improved Toad Scene 2 (handjob and swallow) and added mouth cum.
- Now, you can return to the ground (in 1-4) from the underwater pipe.
- Glitch Fix: certain situations (when you have invulnerable creatures) could make a sex action occur while the creature and the princess are almost transparent (alpha 30), and this could make the creature like that, even after the scene (dead/sleeping).
- Glitch Fix: text balloons being held in certain Zess T, Toad and Toadsworth scenes.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was saying 'Oh!! I had vaginal sex with a girl!!' when leaving Daisy's room in her palace, even not making any love to her. Also this message was appearing in later palaces (like 3-7, 4-7).
- Glitch Fix: a few inverted text balloons in stand scene due to partial BUG fix in Update 2.1.9. (Tech info: TextBalloon talk 4 must not use flipBalloon, but some scenes were inverting it even so, so it needed localized fixes - manual input of flipBalloon externally).
- BUG FIX: Inverted Phanto Balloons (since 2.2.2). Why it was not fixed earlier? Simple. Fewer people are playing the game and noticing those bugs in order to warn me (put a meme here).
- BUG FIX: Pow Blocks stopped working.
- BUG FIX: Eagle doors not working correctly, and without their common open/close sounds.
- BUG FIX: When pressing PANIC key (enter) during a scene, the princess was getting duplicated (and locked).
- BUG FIX: Vertical pipes (those the princess can enter by walking on it) still locking herself up when using it, then returning from another vertical pipe almost immediatelly.

Update 2.2.6 (11th September 2014)
- NEW: Chuck scenes 1, 2, 3 and 4!!!
- New pose: crouching frontside (looking at us) while swinging her butt. It will happen if the princess crouches while horny and stays that way for a while.
- Improved crouching while leaving vases, and now the princess will be invulnerable for a bit.
- Now you can change those options that can be changed only in worldmap (Belly Size and Allow Scroll Levels) in other areas like Peach Castle or before starting a game (character screen).
- Now the princess might get different effects upon drinking a wrong mixed solution in the Concoctionator (level 9-1: X-naut's base).
- Improvements for text balloons (avoiding 'sticky/duplicated' balloons)
- Bug FIX: Muted starman song and starhill star.
- Bug FIX: in level 3-2, when leaving the first vase, the princess was 'invencible' (trespassing enemies and not activating pipes/vases anymore).
- Bug FIX: duplicated Princess when leaving certain vases with nearby enemies.
- Bug FIX: Toads and Bobombs getting unlocked in the gallery after the first scene.
- Bug FIX: (internal tech info): mistaken 'FLAGS on action' with 'PLAYER on action'. Certain scenes are working wonky, like double Princess when leaving vases above.
- Bug FIX: a wonky screen of 'Peach losing her virginity' was appearing if she was fucking in her pussy (in the end of the scene) then the player loaded a level (if cheat was on) or a saved game in the load game screen.
- BUG FIX: The princess wasnt being able to 'fuck' the vegetables if she grabbed it from the red leaves once.
- BUG FIX: The princess was locking herself up while pressing masturbation key in top of the vases.
- BUG FIX: Auto Scroll button option not working.
- Bug FIX: The princess was not grabbing the straws (in levels like 2-5) correctly (she was being blocked after it). Also, she was grabbing it 'by the side' (instead of frontside).
- Bug FIX: Chuck Scene 3 making the current character without her leg near the end of it.
- Bug FIX: annoying bug that makes Daisy show chainballs on her. The problem is that Daisy reuses Peach body, and the princess can have those chainballs in certain situations, AFTER the first scene (teasing and kissing Peach). While Daisy is talking to Peach, chainballs was expected to be hidden. (Tech info: even forcing them to disappear in onEnterFrame, changing scale - x<0 x>0 - is making them back). Chainballs are now deleted (no more bug) but I may create a talking pose/action differently, in case Peach talks in the prision, so chainballs, if present, will appear.
- BUG FIX (NEEDS MORE TEST): The princess was getting locked up right when falling from the sky, after having sex to the koopalings, like Larry or Wendy. 

Update 2.2.5 (26th August 2014)
- NEW enemy: CHUCK (the football player from SMW). You can stomp him, heImp can run, etc, but no scenes yet. He appears in 3-2, 4-2, and more than once in 6-1. He also appears in 1-3 and 4-3 but only if you nished the game once.
- Added 'shred intimate areas' feature. She will get bottomless (technically) if a given creature fucks her ass or pussy while she is wearing pants, as it will be shred, making her exposed.
- Added proper outfits in her buttocks area in certain poses like when she is fucked by the mushroom dicks.
- Rule change: the option 'Act as a Nymph/Slut' will be always ON if the princess is already a Nymph in the game. No way to disable it since then. This button was made to make the princess a slut/nymph earlier, for those who prefer a daring princess. Disabling it later in the game when she is a nymph already is cheating, because this will change endings/bonuses behavior (in the future, the princess should Marry Mario if she is virgin, for example). In the future, it might be possible to force her to be embarrassed even with 1000 laids/sex scenes, but the ending will still take her as a pure nymph.
- Glitch Fix: a chain ball appearing on a glance in Daisy, when she is stopped in her scene with the princess in 2-7.
- Glitch Fix: Daisy walking with the current princess outfits like when they talk in her bedroom (in 2-7)
- Glitch Fix: some events not timing correctly with Sir Grodus. For example, if the princess is taken to her room by him, after sticking the cd, she might need to visit his lounge room again just to 'pass by there' in order to make TEC-XX understand she really put the cd.
- BUG FIX: Wendy scene showing futa even if 'Futanari' is 'NO' in the options.
- BUG FIX: Bubulber scene making the current princess disappear
- BUG FIX: Thwomp scene (anal) locking the current princess up.
- BUG FIX: Third x-naut sex scene freezing the princess.
- BUG FIX: An ANNOYING bug when 'Act as a Nymph/Slut' is ON. Invisible yoshis and Marios were taking her.
- BUG FIX: Another ANNOYING bug when Act as a Nymph/Slut or if the princess is horny enough. In mushroom dicks or with yoshis, she is not getting some invulnerability after the scene, trapping her there forever.
- Info: Forced actualYoshi false when 'next level' and 'restart'. Dont know the outcomes.
- Cosmetic changes, like improvement to Thwomp scene 2, the princess' horny bar increasing normally if she fucks the TEC-XXX dildo.

Update 2.2.4 (10th August 2014)
- NEW level (Goomba Land) with a japanese area too (Goujin)! Its in World 1. No way to enter the goomba castle yet. 
- NEW SCENE (Koopaling Wendy) by Blargh! Wendy can now be Stomped/'Interacted'. Its in the gallery. To enjoy it at most, please unlock it normally without cheating, fucking the koopalings.
- NEW: Futanari mode (YES/NO) in the options. If ON, futa content will be shown in the game. This is NOT 'Princess can be futa' option!
- NEW Thwomp scene (Ass one) by Blargh! And Thwomps in the gallery! Now the scenes will happen in each level they are (new levels will 'reset' their wish to fuck the princess), so the player can fuck 2 times at each level they appear and still retain her virginity, if any. 
- New goomba pose/mode: 'standing/guarding'. He will fuck the princess if she touches him. The princess can still knock him down.
- New "spike" goomba. He may appear in later worlds or exceptionally in early levels. The princess wont be able to stomp on him. If she tries to, she will be hurt.
- New goombas: 'goombario', 'uncle' (moustached goomba) and 'old' ('meh' goomba). They ARE FRIENDS but they can fuck the princess (a button will appear, so the player can choose to interact or not), and they can be stomped. If the princess is either horny or a nymph, they will fuck her right away! They will appear more often after certain levels or in certain later worlds, and surely in Goomba Land level.
- New showroom pose: Princess laid with her butt raised up (in 'Outfit Room' Screen)
- Falling Princess (when she loses a life) will be 'at front' of everything, avoiding the 'Princess falling behind flowers and ground' glitch at certain times.
- Default screen size is now 785x500 instead of 942x600 (a faster game for slower machines). But you can still resize it if you use Adobe Flash Projector, Irfanview or a browser which can resize it.
- Added thwomps to the ghost house (world 3)
- Added 'finished times' feature. If you finish the game, then ask to restart it (either in the 'coins' screen or THE END screen), certain enemies can change, like goombas (some can appear with spikes right in the beginning levels).
- Rule change: Now, Toads will blush if the princess is wearing striker outfits, as they're 'too tight' and some boob areas are seen.
- Rule change: Now, the creatures wont 'keep exclamating' if the princess is near them (and they are facing her). Many will keep their dicks raised and walking faster until the princess is really out of their view. This fixes a little glitch when some enemies like goombas and koopas seemed to be 'having parkinson' when changing directions because when they touched a wall while the princess is behind this wall, they would keep following her due to exclamation. (tech info: keepExclamation and changeDirection with enemyExclamationEnd).
- BUG FIX: Starman powerup trespassing the ground.
- BUG FIX: Some poison mushrooms (those which dont 'walk', as they're just standing there) werent appearing correctly. (tech info: living and not living having the same code wrongly).
- Glitch Fix: The princess was still saying slutty/random phrases in the gallery in a given scene, even if not a nymph.
- Glitch Fix: Piranha Gallery not being unlocked correctly. REMEMBER that, if the problem happens with Birdo and some other creatures, CHECK IF ANAL SCENES IS 'NO' (or VORE, in the case of Boss Bass). You need to use EACH scene to unlock it all. In the future, I'll make the creature 'fuck' the princess differently, if Allow Anal is 'NO' (e.g. just rubbing in her butt).
- Cosmetic changes, like 'sleeping' goombas in more levels, goombas in certain World4 levels.

Update 2.2.3 (2nd August 2014)
- NEW level (1-2!) by me. The other levels were 'shifted' (the SMW forest will be 1-3 and so ). The platfoevel is now a bonus one, but you still need to unlock it by playing certain levels first.
- NEW: 2 music (Mario Bros 1 classic remastered and Mario Desert), with better instruments and changes to certain rhythms. Improved 'toad house' music (ding ding song), which was with 'silent' frames in each loop.
- NEW: 2 new Peach sounds ('oh no' and 'ohhhhh......no') to be used in certain circunstances.
- NEW: 2 toadsworth scenes (1 'bigger bed scene - sex lessons') and 1 'suck to wake him up' scene. Not in the gallery yet.
- NEW: Mushroom dicks scene! (up to 8 'subscenes'). Its those dick-shapes things that appear in certain levels like 'Mario's Pad' level near Peach's Castle.
- NEW: Thwomp scene by Blargh (be careful, its a vaginal one)!
- NEW Princess action: "Masturbating in the pipes"! For that, the princess needs to masturbate near a 'vertical' pipe (those normal ones). Beware! The princess may not 'do it' in certain pipes where she can't go/come from. Maybe because she is afraid of something inside an unkonwn pipe.
- NEW Toad pose: 'ashamed'. If the princess is bottomless/topless and SOME toads see her like that, they will blush and their dick might get hard!
- NEW Toad pose: panic. If Mario and the kingdom were not saved yet, some toads might panic.
- Improvement to all Toadsworth code and objects. Added his legs (it's common to find him in the games without legs, to optimize drawings and time). For our game, legs are interesting for sexual purposes and more smooth poses.
- Improvement to music system and some fixes. (Tech info: the return of 'ALL MUSIC inside mC to dimish 'white screen' effect before the game loads).
- Improvement to some toad poses. Certain naked ones were not showing any dick.
- Improvement to Bub-ulber (the flower man) code. He was falling sometimes (in cliffs). He should turn direction instead.
- Improvement to embarrassed Princess (while covering her pussy). Now her pussy will drip if she is horny, and she might 'spurt' cum in this state.
- A simple floating function to certain objects and creatures like the toad in the Toadella's Bath in Peach's castle.
- Toads will now detect if the princess is with 'too much cum', and they might talk about it if you press the button when touching each of them.
- Rule change: now you will be able to select item number '7' to allow the toad to choose which action he wants to do with the princess, when she talks to him.
- Rule change: Days wont count while in worldmap. Its like the princess is still using the afternoon / night of the latest level to go to another one.
- Rule change: if the princess is a nymph, she will be protected in less time after each scene or by using pipes / doors. Beware!
- Rule change: now, the princess will be able to masturbate using veggies, even if not horny enough and still innocent. The reason is that the player has the freedom to force the princess to pleasure herself. If the player wants her to avoid masturbation, just dont make her do it!
- Glitch Fix: Days wont go to '0' if 999 is reached. Future days wont be counted, as the game will understand the player wants to keep in the game 'forever'. Its like saying 'meh, I wont count it anymore for you, dont worry about it'.
- Glitch Fix: Powerup icon (like in the HUD and Pause Screen) blinking for a fraction of a second to change its type.
- Glitch Fix: sometimes, when going to other screens like the pause menu, gallery and 'lost virginity' while touching a door or a item to be used (pink/blue round button), it was possible to activate it, even being hidden due to the screen, giving unpredictable behavior.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was duplicating herself when 2 or more pipes being used during 'masturbating pipes' action (it occurs more in nearby pipes).
- Glitch Fix: strange repeating (and annoying) 'yelp' sound when the princess is fully horny during certain scenes.
- Glitch Fix: The princess wont say 'I am undressed' to Toadsworth in the case she is not.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was still getting out of the shadowy room as a shadow.
- Small cosmetic changes like changes to some level names, better princess thigh/legs (changes to outlines/shadows), little adjustement to 'front bang shines' on Peach/Fire Peach  and the addition to 'mushroom dicks' in a given level of World 3.

Update 2.2.2 (23th july 2014)
- "Aligned" and recompressed music in source code (music are now mp3 inside), due to the discover of the "440mb+ FLA could crash all flash PRO versions" bug.
- NEW creature: Lakitu (with 2 sex scenes and 1 'pole' scene). You can find him in 1-2 (special area), in 1-4, then in more 'exposed' areas along the game levels (world 3, 4 and 6). Not in the gallery yet.
- NEW creature: Jabbi! (No scene yet but they can hurt the princess). They appear in 4-4.
- Nipper Plant scene 1 by me. Certain Nippers will just harm the princess. try to discover the ones that will fuck her.
- Thwomp scene 1 (WHAT???) by Blargh! In order to see it, the princess must act fast in order not to be hurt instead (when Thwomp falls on her). A tip is to jump on him (bug him) while he is not moving, or when going back from the stomp.
- Piranhas and Nipper plant now in the gallery (Nipper is regarded as a piranha type there).
- Improved Thwomp expression anges.
- Rule change: in the gallery, if the princess is not a nymph already (10 laids in the current level or 80+ in the entire game), she will say the default text in each scene (embarrassing ones).
- Rule change: all Nippers will be eager to fuck the princess if she is horny enough.
- Rule Change: the princess can find a dress in her bedroom now (for the first time). But later, the dress might be there or not.
- New Princess expression: 'eyes of pleasure'. It will be seen in certain scenes, like Lakitu ones.
- Added a new area in 4-4 (Jabbi area of Boggly Tree level) and a new quest: the princess needs to do something in order to exit the level.
- Faster and improved Yoshi code
- Improved 'screen control' and 'screen list control' code (invisible change for the player). Maybe there is a faster screen maneuvering (e.g. going to the gallery, then to the options screen).
- New bedroom/warehouse area in Peach's Castle (go to the kitchen, then climb the ladder while looking at the right).
- BUG FIX: Starman not getting 'off' if using pipes (tech info: unite 2 other commands inside IF function).
- BUG FIX: (NEED MORE TESTING): bobombs unlocking gallery right in the first scene. (tech info): 'double frame' for 'dead code' to work well.
- BUG FIX: (NEED MORE TESTING): Wrench guy 4th still locking the princess up in the end (paw pussy scene).
- BUG FIX: The princess was 'falling' through ground in certain levels like Mario's Pad (pipe house) and underground pipes (when leaving from worldmaps) when ZOOMED IN.
- BUG FIX: goomba not giving the key to the princess if she fucks him in 1-2 (tech info: 'enemyNum' being '0' and tested wrongly (0=false rule). Using name instead)
- BUG FIX: Flurry scenes with the princess (or any enemy near the IGLOOS that spawns flurries) making her disappear with him 'forever'.
- BUG FIX: The princess was able to activate the shower scene even being far away from the poll (like in the right), in her castle.
- BUG FIX: The princess was locking herself up when returning to the same pipe she left (like the underwater red pipe in 5-3).
- BUG FIX: The princess was warping in strange situations (being stuck) certain bonus areas in 5-3. Also, a pipe was 'with no ground', making her 'fall' through it instead of being over it.
- BUG FIX: 500,000 score points not giving the bonus scene.
- BUG FIX: Inverted balloons in Piranha Plant scenes.
- POSSIBLE BUG Fix (NEED MORE TESTING): Level hole '2' in all worldmaps was being deactivated after finishing level 2, or returning to a given worldmap later.
- Glitch Fix: Corrected the 'white screen' glitch (Flash internal). Now the loader will function correctly.
- Glitch Fix: some characters still showing blonde pubes while facing frontside, like Daisy and Rosalina.
- Glitch Fix: Pokey 'one bead(head)' handjob scene was taking the princess virginity away.
- Glitch Fix: Inverted balloons during some Luma scenes in places like the Bonus Toad house level.
- Glitch Fix: moved 2 blueprints because the princess was not getting them correctly.
- Glitch Fix: Poison mushroom not disappearing when touching it in certain levels like 1-2.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was trespassing tiny spaces between blocks and walls in the Desert Grey Castle (level 2-4).

Update 2.2.1 (4th july 2014)
- NEW Level: 6-2 and 6-3 by me.
- NEW area: 'sky clouds' area in level 1-2 (try to find it, using a given block).
- NEW scene: 'mechanical hands' (claws in E.gadd lab). If you keep activating the hands (using the buttons) and stay there for a while, something might happen...
- NEW creature: SockHop. You can find him in certain levels. He's a green sack, and he will suck the princess inside if she jumps on him (a cute scene). if he touches her, he will harm her.
- NEW friend: Poochy (the dog). He can appear in certain levels and talk to the princess.
- NEW Poochy scene (3 in a row but in a single big scene!) It uses the dialogue system, so you can make different combos (e.g. do a handjob, make the princess cum more than twice, then do a handjob again).
- NEW bobomb scene (6th) by me.
- NEW drybone scene (6th) by me.
- NEW music (in some areas of 1-2 and 6-3) and many music changes towards a CC / music made from scratch (just to be more creative and to avoid reusing copyrighted music used in other games). This makes the game more unique.
- NEW creature: Jellyfish sisters in 6-2 with massaging scene by me (already in the gallery). Try to unlock the gallery for her (by fucking all of her 'friends', aside of Toads).
- NEW art (Cook Peach) in Peach Castle, By Susuki. Try to find it. It will only be shown in a given area if you do certain tasks and perhaps revisit the castle, so its better not to pay to much attention.
- NEW toad females: 'Rinni' (try to find her) and 'Kris T. Female' (not yet in the game, but graphics are already set).
- Improved Toadette (with chubbier legs, better face and overall look)
- NEW screen: 'Airship destruction'. After beating an airship, this screen shows up (with our dear character getting saved on time!).
- NEW possibility: 'Keep Playing'. After the endings, you can keep playing (the current princess back to Peach's castle). You wont be able to 'finish' the game anymore, so you can wander around and find new goodies and actions. For now, some coins and things like Mario in new areas, like in his Pipe House. The princess can please him anytime!
- The messagebox area (e.g. when the princess talks to someone) is now placed in the bottom. The status message will overlap it in certain circunstances. This is to give more room for 'dialogue scenes', like Daisy and Poochy. If the box is still in the front of some 'bottom' scenes, just zoom it, so the princess will be centered.
- Some changes in blocks in level 1-5.
- Some improvements to platform code (those seen in 1-5)
- Rule Change: Now bobomb scene 6th will make the second bobomb fuck her pussy too (they both will use their dicks! Please do it slow!) if 'Anal' is 'NO' in the options.
- Rule Change: In Zess T scene, the princess now needs to use the apron in order to help Zess T.
- Glitch Fix: The princess wont be 'falling' from the airship endlessly when GOING to a given palace level (1-7,2-7...) in the Load Game screen (warp to a given level), in the case cheating is ON) when the princess is already falling just after beating the Koopaling. She will now appear correctly in the start of the level.
- Glitch Fix: in certain situations, Bobombs could fuck the princess' ass even if ANAL is 'NO'.
- Glitch ATTEMPT Fix: Birdo disappearing in certain end of levels, ALONG with the purple ball. If Birdo is not there, the ball MUST be there.
- Glitch Fix: Goomba's bodies exchanging colors in the prologue screen
- More Peach sounds for certain easter eggs in the menus.

Update 2.2.0 (14th june 2014)
- NEW level: 6-1 by me (it's 'finisheable', but more art and places to come).
- NEW: Suntanning machine with a scene in level 6.1. Peach (if the default model) will turn Tanned Peach if she stays enough time there. Also, tanned Peach can have the tanline or not. In the future, she will have more tanline types, like when she uses the 'decent' swimsuit. Try to find the machine.
- NEW: Princess scenes in the gallery: Toadella Bath and Broom.
- NEW: Drybone scene 4 and 5 by me.
- NEW: Toad scene 23 by me.
- NEW: Don Pianta and THREE scenes (in level 6-1). Already in the gallery (FRIENDS button).
- NEW: Cataquacks in 6-1 with 1 scene. They can pull the princess upwards. Try to find a sexual scene. Already in the gallery (FRIENDS button).
- NEW: Mario scene 5 (beware, the current princess will lose her virginity if any). So far, you can only find it when the princess finds (and talk to) Mario in the end of the game or if you select 'Keep Playing' and find Mario in certain levels like Peach's Castle, or by using cheating (gallery).
- Extended Wrench Guy scene 4 (with a vaginal sex subscene, with his animal dick, and a better 'grab').
- Extended Anuboo scene 4 (cum loop, where the princess 'deepens' her pussy inside his penis).
- NEW: A 'Virginity break' vaginal scene for Wigglers, X-nauts, Anuboos and Flurries
- NEW: Thwomp and Thwimp by Biles! They're a revamped version, already in grey castle levels.
- NEW: Nibbles in the game (try to find them). If the princess touches them, they will bite her ass.
- Rule change: Toad scenes wont shred the princess clothes anymore, like it was in Fingering, 69 and Audience ones. Maybe in the future, I can make a given sub scene where a given Toad fucks the princess and he shreds it by mistake (at random occurrences), then the princess can say 'huh?' or something like that.
- Improvements to pokey 'Ace of High' scene. No more 'space/shift' key insistences to cum.
- Glitch Fix: Sometimes, the princess was getting in a sex scene in certain situations (instead of stomping certain enemies) like right after jumping on a platform. The princess might stomp on enemies more easily now. 
- Glitch: Sometimes, exiting the menu while in Toad's Town would make the camera go downwards a bit (showing a black rectangle in the game area). Tech info: moved boundary and structures 50 to 200 pixels downwards (boundary-boundary distances must be bigger). EDIT: Still some 'trespassing' happens in certain areas, to be fixed later.
- Glitch Fix: when the princess was flying, she was 'with standing pose' when touching grounds and walls
- Glitch Fix: 'Frozen duplicated balloons' along the levels are now vanished (when you were watching the scenes in the gallery).
- Glitch Fix: Princess 'walking a bit to the left or right' after Chompette scene 2 and 3 in the gallery! This should happen only in the real game (not paused).
- Glitch Fix: Flurry scene 4 (Frozen Pussy): The princess was without her vest, shell (if she is a hammerbro) and tail (if a raccoon).
- Glitch Fix: Internal cumshot in 'Koopa Squatting scene' was wrong. 
- Glitch Fix: The princess was cumming in her arms being retained after going out of the gallery and activating the button "Cum Arms".
- Glitch Fix: when the princess throws a koopa shell (after grabbing it) in the dark area (shadowy room in Toad Town), the shell appeared colored (like not in the dark).
- BUG FIX: The princess was still in shadow mode when leaving the shadowy room in Toad's town.
- BUG FIX: Stand scene (Peach's Castle: the princess being duplicated).
- BUG Fix: Chompette tongue 'walking away' (!!??) in lick scene.

Update 2.1.9 (20th may 2014)
- NEW: Boo scene 5 and 6 by me.
- NEW: Toad Scene 21 and 22 by me.
- NEW: Grodus scene 1 by me (if he's in the lobby room, the princess is visible and she gives him some answers).
Sir Grodus may appear in other areas of 9-1, beware!
- NEW option: 'Camera skip' in the options screen (making it more evident). Its a setting to make the game more responsive in slower machines since Update 2.0.9, but it was being activated by pressing * in the keypad (wrongly listed as \ key). It will be saved for later games if you click in 'Save Options'. 
- NEW: If timer is UP (400 seconds), the princess will get fucked by a random enemy once in a level.
- NEW: You now can force the princess to be a slut already (erhm...a nymph). Its in the options screen ("Act as a Nymph/Slut"). You can, for example, make her a nymph right in the beginning of the game because she just wants it. Then revert it back in level 1-2, then reuse in level 1-4. If this button is 'NO', but the princess already fucked 10 or more creatures in a level, or 80 or more in the entire game, she will remain as a nymph.
- NEW: Now the princess can 'have a seat' in some little mountains, like in the level 3-4 (just walk to the right and check if a pink button appears. Press it or UP key). The idea is to make the princess sit in more of these objects for fun, in other levels, then in the future she can masturbate or sleep as well.
- NEW: Some Igloos in world 5 might have Flurries inside.
- NEW: The goombas will now masturbate (with one of their foot) if they see the princess in a sexual scene.
- NEW: A 'Virginity break' vaginal scene for toad, goomba, koopa, shyguy, bobomb, boo, pokey, chain chomp and blooper (try to find them). Of course it will appear once in a game. E.g. if Peach is fucked in the pussy by a goomba, no way to see her losing her virginity again in a koopa scene. The creature will fuck her differently (slower penetration) and a light blood will come out.
- Rule change: Shyguys wont leave vases if the current princess is near them.
- Rule change: Enemies who detect the princess nearby (exclamation mark) will not keep following her (like turning to her side endlessly like Parkinson's) if they touch walls or obstacles like bricks that make they turn direction. They will now keep walking normally to the other side. If the princess gets in front of their eyesights again, they will notice her normally until hitting another obstacle. More tests needed.
- Rule change: the princess will lose her invencibility if she talks to someone or activate a button (preventing blinking during the scene). Just be careful when leaving the current scene if a given enemy is nearby. I'll do this on purpose so you need to be more careful to not get caught.
- Enemies will 'stop walking' as before (like in Update 1.6n) if they are following a horny princess but they are blocked by a wall, for example. It stopped working because of the new collision code (maybe in 1.9.9).
- Small adjustment to enemies, so they can climb stepper slopes.
- BUG FIX: In Zess T (Cook) scene, the princess was disappearing.
- BUG FIX: "Tender Vore Scenes" button was not being deactivated.
- BUG FIX: Birdo's fireball disappearing earlier in certain levels like 3-6. It should disappear if it walks for 10 seconds or more.
- BUG FIX: When entering in the gallery in the title screen (before the game starts in Peach's Castle), the game was freezing.
- PARTIAL BUG FIX: Inverted balloons in Charlieton spank scene, Morton and Larry scene, and the Stand (microphone table) in her castle.
- BUG FIX: The princess was locking herself up in the red x-naut scene.
- BUG FIX: In 9-1, after going to the lab for the second, time, TEC will order you to go to your bed to sleep. Sometimes the princess was skipping her self dialogue saying she is ready to sleep. She must not do that, because this trigger the sleeping scene, in order for TEC to open his computer door, in the end of the corridor.
- Glitch Fix: Boo possession scene (where the princess blows his dick): pink text outside balloon in certain circunstances (tech info: 'H' flipped balloon wrongly)
- Glitch Fix: "Allow Anal Sex" not reactivating in the options.
- Glitch Fix: some fixes in the music system. Sometimes, when leaving the game with MUSIC OFF, replaying the game later would make it appear again, even if in the options the music was OFF. Also, music volumes wont reactive the music if sounds are showing 'NO MUSIC' /NO BGM.
- Glitch Fix: Kamek's shoes are now red.
- Glitch Fix: Boos were stopping in the air if they're just over the princess (or under her), parallel with her body axis.
- Glitch Fix: The princess was walking in place when stocking her clothes in the locker, level 9-1 (lab room).
- Glitch Fix: The player cant skip the princess getting invisible when taking the potion anymore (if he keeps pressing SPACE or SHIFT quickly) in 9-1.
- Glitch Fix: Now the princess will also use Grodus' office table when the user press UP key when the button appears, instead of pressing the button with the mouse.
- Glitch Fix: Blooper scene 3 will be 'more responsive' in case the player wants to skip it pressing SPACE/SHIFT.
- Glitch Fix: shyguys will follow the princess correctly when leaving vases.

Update 2.1.8 (1st may 2014)
- NEW: new algorithm for FOREGROUND balloons. I call 'Dynamic Ordering of Foreground Objects & Balloons' (DOFOB). Now we can see them in front of trees, houses and anything in the foreground layer. Credits for Anonymouse (who helped me with a scale algorithm).
- Improved buttons (doors, objects and enemies), when the princess touches them. The button won't follow the camera anymore (if the princess walks around while the button is active).
- NEW: You can select 'clean cum while underwater': (YES/NO) in the options screen.
- NEW: You can select 'allow anal sex': (YES/NO). Beware that there are still certain scenes like TURNIP masturbation and some Koopalings where she will still fuck her own ass (even if its 'NO' - OFF). Its planned to make Koopalings spare her ass in the future (if 'NO'). 
Also, if you select anal scenes in dialogues (like with the Big Mushroom being in level 1-2), it will be forced (the current princess will end up being fucked in her bumhole), so choose another number in the message box if you dont want her doing that.
- NEW: Charlieton action (the seller man in Toad's Town): try to find it.
- NEW: Two new music: Marrymore and Jinx (Monstro Town), remastered using MIDI.
- NEW: Marrymore area (the castle where the princess can marry and have some dialogues). Its in TOAD FOREST area (one of the houses, after Toad Town), try to find it. No scenes yet.

- Daisy Scene Dialogues: 'Anilingus 69' renamed to just '69'.
- Glitch Fix: crazy blackmith toad going up and down quickly like having Parkinson when the princess is near him (in TOAD FOREST). He was supposed to hide if the princess is near.

- Glitch Fix: 'Arms cum' and 'Hair cum' buttons were not present in the gallery.

- Cosmetic fixes and changes, like a quick glitch in koopa race (e.g. a green one appearing in the hog hole, then turning red).

Update 2.1.6 (4th april 2014) - SERVICE PACK 3 (32 fixes)
- NEW: Toad Scene 19 and 20 by Blargh!
- NEW: Princess and Daisy scene 1 (kissing), scene 2 (in the bed while sucking), scene 3 (sleeping) and scene 4 (Tribadism), in Daisy Palace (2-7 level). All made by me. Not in the gallery yet. There are options for further scenes (up to 9) but most of them not made yet! They might change yet (add/removal).
- NEW: Now, when you knock down Birdo (or are fucked by her), she will spit a purple ball. Grab it to open the eagle door. Certain levels might provide a purple ball if no Birdo nearby.
- NEW: Two Peach art by Susuki. One of them is a portrait replacement for Kamek scene in the prologue (Wall portraits), and the other in Daisy's bedroom.
- NEW: 'Maximum Cum' option: you can now configure how much cum the princess will be drenched. 
- NEW: Belly feature can now be turned on (YES/NO). Default is YES. That setting is global, that is, if you set it YES, all loaded games will make her have a given belly size (if any). I dont plan adding Max Belly and Min Belly sizes. In the future I might put a "Lock current belly size".
- NEW: You can 'empty' the princess' belly in the toilet if you want so.
- NEW: Now if you get 5 cherries, a starman will appear flying upwards (like SMB2).
- ADDED some veggies in level 3-6 so you can try to knock Red Birdo down.
- ADDED 'Clean All' button for more baths.
- IMPROVED collision algorithm if the princess jumps through shallow areas (with blocks) like in the pyramids. Peach wont be getting blocked if passing through non hittable blocks.
- More doors that make Peach invulnerable for a bit (like in grey castle and ghost house levels) to avoid immediate fucking due to a nearby enemy.
- Kamek now uses a correct magic (polygon fire) in the prologue area, to change the portraits to dirty ones.
- Shadow Dogs (Anuboo), Boss Bass and Cheep Cheep can now be stomped with fireballs and veggies.
- Birdo Gallery: You can see other Birdo poses and select other races before clicking on each scene
- Rule changes: Player cant press 'DEL' to make Peach die in the worldmap anymore
- Rule changes: Boss Bass (big fish) will die after the sex scene.
- Rule changes: If Peach is grabbing a veggie and you make her masturbate, she will say "no" if she is not a nymph/whore or not horny enough.
- Rule changes: 'scrolling Levels' option can only be disabled in the worldmap. Thats to avoid cheating, like deactivating it in the airship on-the-fly in order to explore the left area again. If you want to do this, deactivate it before going to the level.
- Rule changes: Peach will now say dirty things (random phrases) if she makes sexual contact while being a nymph/whore (greater than 10 fucks in a given level or greater than 80 fucks in the entire game). If the player hasnt seen the innocent dialogues with x-nauts for example (because she has more than 10 laids), he can play the level again (those '10' will get reset). If more than 80, he can only check it if he plays the game again and try to fuck less enemies. This increases gameplay, because you will always get different dialogues in each game, according to your rush to fuck them. This is because when Peach turns into a nymph, she WILL be dirty. She is crazy to have sex endlessly without any innocence or 'OH NO!' dialogues.
- **TESTING** (while using the cheat code): If you go back to old castles and redo them, you lock newer worlds. E.g. you went to airship5 and finished it. Going to the airship 2 would LOCK world 4 and 5. this is not a bug per see but it could be annoying.
- Glitch Fix: Menu not pausing the 'koopa in a shell' timer. So, if you went to the menu, coming back from it after a while was showing him outside the shell, ready to fuck Peach.
- Glitch Fix: Poison mushroom wont harm Peach if she is invulnerable or using starman anymore.
- Glitch Fix: camera not centralizing correctly if Peach is in the edge of worldmap or in certain level boundaries (TECH INFO: calibrate not in menu_hide() which controls key square in controlL).
- Glitch Fix: Raccoon Peach could 'walk' while locked up if you let TAIL ATTACK button pressed.
- Glitch Fix: Toads werent counting in sex scenes (no LAID counters).
- Glitch Fix: When Peach leaves her castle while wearing Raccoon or Yoshi powerups/outfits, she was being detected as 'stark naked' (embarrassing scene).
- Glitch Fix: no way to put the pink dress in you inventory, in X-naut level. The intention is to use it or not.
- Glitch Fix: the darn chainball appearing again when Peach is in statue mode (racooon) and goes back to normal mode.
- Glitch Fix: Sparklies (yellow fire ball beings) will now 'pause' when we are in the main screen (pause menu).
- Glitch Fix: Sewers accumulating Koopas on the incoming pipe and Invisible Koopas in Sewers.
- Glitch Fix: Reset Game via Menu play last music heard after Bowser's laughter
- Glitch Fix: When stomping the bobomb buddy and rushing to use the computer before the 'K.O.' messagebox, you cant use the computer anymore, having to exit the bunker and go inside again.
- Glitch fix: 'Peeing sound' not being stopped while using certain toilets.
- Glitch Fix: Piranha Plants being killed by fireballs/veggies even if they are inside the pipe, and even from a distance (e.g. in a row of pipes, hitting in pipe 1 and killing the piranha in pipe 4).
- Glitch Fix: Sometimes when leaving the vines while jumping and pressing UP+LEFT or UP+RIGHT, Peach was falling 'locked', like a 'falling fruit'.
- Glitch Fix: Scenes sequence not saved when you save a game, close and load it.
- Glitch Fix: Fireballs were not precise in some enemies (tech info: 'skip 1,2,3' not possible, it must be each frame).
- Glitch Fix: Peach was falling when reaching the end of vines and ladders, instead of just stopping climbing.
- Glitch Fix: When Peach was bursted by a goomba next to the piranha plant, both sex scenes were activating.
- Glitch Fix: Double Peach in Pokey scenes if Peach throws a fireball/veggie on pokey, then punch the information block (purple soundbox) while pokey touches her.
- Glitch Fix: Peach appearing at Delfino Worldmap in certain circunstances, like when she dies (in the worldmap), or comes from the airship to the bunker
- Glitch Fix: When Peach went to the mushroom-labeled pipe in the worldmap, the world/level names in the pipe corridors were wrong (like 'Desert World: Dry Dry Land'), and when going to the sewers and her castle, that information was still there.
- BUG FIX: World 9-2: Cleft scenes duplicating Peach and this causing freezing occurrences to Peach seconds later (like when jumping).
- BUG FIX: If Peach loses the last life while being a fire peach, she was appearing in the prison with the ability to cast fireballs.
- BUG FIX: If you press masturbation key while Peach walks/runs in the worldmap at the same time, she was being locked in masturbation pose while moving around.
- BUG FIX: Red and Blue xnauts was seeing her even if she was invisible, without clothes and clean.
- BUG FIX: Gallery not unlocking to Koopa and Chompette even if you fuck all scenes of each.
- BUG FIX: When using starman, Pokey only loses one 'bead' instead of fully dying
- BUG FIX: Peach locking herself up when grabbing and throwing a vegetable while hitting a block (e.g. like in Bonus Toad House level).
- BUG FIX: Koopa shells that you take and throw (like vegetables) gave freezing koopas that you can't touch once resurrected. They walked on place.
- BUG FIX: Shells floating when you jump on a mid-air Koopa.
- Cosmetic changes, like in TEC dialogue in 9-1 to indicate better that there are enemies ouside but TEC will open the door when the corridors are clean.

Update 2.1.5 (21th march 2014)
- Daisy and Peach scene (A STUB!) Its a NEW MECHANIC (you can check it in 2-7, Daisy bedroom): ability to talk to Daisy and see a given scene. (Its INCOMPLETE YET). It uses "Body engine exchanger" (BEE) to princesses and Krystal in the future.  Thats nothing more than a given algorithm to treat scenes that contain two or more characters, each one changing to a given princess depending to variables. So we can even make Peach interact with Daisy and Rosalina (and even more people!) at the same time, while they retain their own clothes. In the basic engine, only one princess could be in the screen at the same time. Trying to put Daisy and Peach would make both become Peach (or Daisy). Daisy placeholder in 2-7 was working before because she was alone (no scene and no dialogue), being another entity. That was not optimized because I would require to make Daisy Walking, Daisy Jumping, and her bodyparts alone, in order not to conflict. Not needed anymore.
- NEW: Bumpties in some icy levels with AI. They wont fall in cliffs and they can respond to embarrassment with moving dicks.
- NEW: Birdo races: pink, green and red. Green ones will spit fireballs SOMETIMES. Red ones, all the time. For those red ones, you need to be fire peach, or get a vegetable to attack her. If not, flee!
- NEW: Bumpty scene 1 and 2 by me.
- NEW: Birdo scene 4 and 5 by me.
- Improvement: Player needs to be walking left or right to make Peach kick the koopa shell.
- Bug Fix: When popping a Flurry out, a Cobrat was appearing out of nowhere
- Bug Fix: Fixed Peach acceleration bug, which made her traverse walls when 'braking' into them just after walking/running.
- Bug Fix (needs testing!): Peach getting locked up in place (or walking left/right while cumming) after certain scenes like toad ones, while her horny bar was full
- Glitch Fix: Peach 'almost falling' (when she is in the corner of the ground) with a correct arm rotation.
- Glitch Fix: shyguy's balls were blinking in scene 1 and 2.
- Glitch Fix: current toad scene/action is being saved and loaded now.
- Glitch Fix: (needs testing!): Koopa appearing 'walking in place' after Peach tries to kick him while inside his shell.
- Glitch Fix: '(Press SPACE or SHIFT)' message when interacting with Lumas (the star guys). You should press 3, not space/shift.
- Glitch Fix: Birdo 'attack' action was with her 'vent' placed wrongly.
- Glitch Fix: Toad Guards' mouth out of place when talking to Peach. 
- Glitch Fix: some Toads were flipping wrongly (to the other side) when Peach was horny, making the text inverted.
- Glitch Fix: Birdo was not spitting eggs in certain situations and levels like 3-4 (Tech info: _x should be 4000 or even more, not 2000)

Update 2.1.4 (14th march 2014)
- NEW: Level 5-6 and AIRSHIP (level 5-7) by me. Added Iggy there (no scene).
- NEW: Worldmap 6 (Delfino Island) is accessible (new remastered music based on MIDI). To exit the game, talk to Mario there (click the button, dont press UP) and select the proper item number.
- NEW: Mario scene 4 by me.
- NEW: Birdo scene 3 by me.
- NEW: Toad Scene 17 by me and 18 by Blargh.
- NEW: Cobrat enemy made (he's in world 2 and 3) and Cobrat inside vases (just jump on him to knock him down).
- NEW: Cobrat scene 1, 2, 3 and 4 by me. Also in the gallery.
- NEW: Sarcophagus in desert levels with pyramids. Gritty goombas might appear from there, be careful.
- NEW: New Toad house, a mountain with yoshi egg and trees by Terrantor! You can check them in certain levels like Yoshi House and in world 4.
- NEW: Belly (4 sizes)! Peach will have a bigger belly if she eats poison, if a given red mushroom is not so tasty, or if she is fucked in certain ways (e.g. grupal scenes or 'big' enemy scenes). Boss scenes might make her with a full Belly size. The belly will also increase if she gets fucked in the ass or pussy three or more times in certain scenes, instead of only in grupal or bosses. No way to set it manually, the player really needs to find ways to increase it. To decrease it, Peach needs to masturbate until orgasm, or when spurting when lowering her legs (one or more times), or after losing a life. In the future, when pregnancy is triggered, even losing a life wont make her normal again. She have to give birth.
- Now, if Peach cums while the enemy fucks her ass or pussy, the horny bar will be exhausted, even if its just partially full. I need someone to indicate me other scenes where she says she is cumming in non anal/vaginal ones (like when enemies finger her or she is expelled from big enemies' mouth, for example).
- Added 3 more selectable toad scenes when greeting one (tease more, tease even more, slip in her asshole).
- Increase of level 2-2 and 2-3, with a bigger straight area with a bunch of trees. The checkpoint in 2-2 is now a bath one.
- Improved Peach 'walking' animation in the worldmap (if the player is pressing RUN key her animation will be faster when going up or down).
- Added a new subscene to punio scene (in the hole area of 4-4).
- Added a phrase in the gallery: "If you want to unlock the items, you have to...erhm...have sexual relations to each creature until exhausting all scenes!"
- Better animation of Peach hands after Chompette action 2.
- BUG Fix: Morton was sometimes walking through the walls in airship 2, then he disappeared.
- BUG Fix: Peach was getting stuck when cumming after certain scenes, like Koopa ones in sewers level (in her Castle).
- Glitch Fix: the cum in Peach's arms, if any, was not being cleaned out if she loses a life.
- Glitch Fix: in level 4-5, when Peach fell in the pitfall, the screen was going down more than requested.
- Glitch Fix: when the player disabled the music in certain worldmaps, activating it again was triggering worldmap1 music.
- Glitch Fix: Peach wont say 'I am extremelly dirty' anymore after Chompette scene, as she was cleaned up instead.
- Removed her saying 'Fuck my pussy the way you love' when Peach gets fucked by Mario. Also, Mario wont fuck her in her pussy while in the train anymore.

Update 2.1.3 (24th february 2014)
- NEW: Level 5-5 by me. Whales dont 'spurt' water yet.
- NEW: Level 'Toad Forest!' Its near Toad Town, try to find it. Thanks Terrantor!
- NEW: Level Ghost House (its in world 3, subcon world). Its an OPTIONAL level. The idea is to make this level have certain powerups, 1 or more 1ups and one of the missing blueprints, so if the player wants to unlock certain levels, he has to play those levels.
- NEW enemy: Gritty Goombas. Some of them are in World 2. They have a spear, so they cant be stomped! To see them in the gallery, just use the button next to the main goomba.
- NEW: Flurry scene 3 and 4 by me.
- NEW: Cleft scene 3 and 4 by me.
- NEW: Mario scene 3 by me. 
- NEW: DryBone scene 1, 2 and 3 by me.
- NEW: Toad Scene 16 by Blargh!
- NEW Outfits: Koopa Slave (for prison scenes) AND Swim Suit (decent version to be used in Delfino Island and in certain areas), both made by me.  
- NEW ENEMY: Boo Platforms (no scenes yet) and Drybones (scenes above).
- NEW: 'spurt' position in the Beds (Peach Castle, X-naut fortress and Mario Bedroom) if Peach sits down while horny.
- NEW: Peach falling (knockout scene!) by OwnerOfSuccuby! If she loses a life, she will be falling like Mario, with her delicious butt blooming.
- NEW: Masturbation with sniffing. This will happen sometimes when pressing masturbation key, or if Peach is just standing up (not walking) while horny enough or a nymph.
- NEW: Train area is now accessible (small level). Just click the button 'Click to play this level' when the train scene appears, right after choosing Peach character.
- Koopa type (by color) can now be chosen in the gallery.
- Gallery should be working okay now. If Peach fucks all different goomba scenes for example (until you detect they will repeat in a given pattern, like an already seen cowgirl or blowjob one), the goomba button MUST BE unlocked. The same with other enemies. "Do-overs" don't count, it must be normal scenes. You can guess the total number of each enemy in order to be unlocked by seeing 'ERO/SEXUAL SCENES IN THE GAME' in page 1 of my forum thread (except 2 goomba scenes, because those are sleeping scenes, dont count them). Endings will get unlocked if you play them all when the game finishes, and they would be auto-saved, so new games would show them unlocked already, until clearing Flash cache, reinstalling the entire flash or using another computer. Peach scenes in the gallery will still be left unlocked until having more scenes, then I'll lock it and the player will need to find all unicque solo Peach scenes, like in her throne.
- Peach now talks to Mario in levels (dialog). Peach can interact with him, either in the train or when she finds him again in the end of the game. 
- Adjusted Boo collisions. Now he needs to touch Peach center in order to fuck her.
- BUG Fix: Level 9-1: when Peach was going back to her bedroom, a dialogue was stuck there, and every time the player pressed SPACE (or SHIFT), she was returning to her bedroom.
- BUG Fix: after the tail attack, a chainball was appearing with the racoon Peach.
- Glitch Fix: strange enemies appearing inside Mario's Pad bedroom if Peach is horny and she is left there while touching the right wall.
- Glitch Fix: Peach hands over her boobs when she covers herself (frontside view) with largest boobs.
- Glitch Fix: double Peach if the player presses DEL key while riding the Yoshi.
- Glitch Fix: red x-nauts not going away when Peach leaves her bedroom while clothed.
- Cosmetic changes like food, plates and bottles in the train restaurant, new cum sounds (mostly when she 'spurts'), fix to her arm in jaunting animation, and improved cum animation that occurs in Jinx scene 3 and when she sniffs her hands.

Update 2.1.2 (11th february 2014)
- NEW Levels by me: 5-1, 5-2, 5-3 and 5-4!!!
- NEW: Random toads might sit down in the dinner table
- NEW: Stand scene by OwnerOfSuccuby! (the 'table' royalties use to communicate, with a microphone). Peach can interact with it.
- NEW Enemy: Flurry with scenes 1 and 2 by me. 
- NEW: Chomp scene 6 (moved to 1st!)
- NEW: Toad Scene 14 and 15 by Blargh!
- NEW: Throne scene (Masturbation 3). And Peach wont be doing those dirty things cheaply anymore (you have to let her 'warmed up' first). 
- NEW Yoshi and Peach scene: 'falling over his nose'. It will happen if Peach stands so much time mounted on him without walking.
- NEW Yoshi and Peach scene: if Peach is horny or already a nymph and touches him, he will do her.
- NEW Chainballs for those who like ENF restraining scenes. Peach will be restrained by it in the prison (if you CONTINUE a game over), but she can still walk. Any scene (or if Peach loses a life) will break the ball.
- NEW feature: Peach bedroom now has turnable lights, and its turned off. The switch is in one of the lamps. Just press UP or click the button near her bed.
- NEW: some cum wobbling/swinging/squeezing objects that will appear in certain scenes.
- NEW eye expression: "Doh". Peach will be like that in certain situations.
- Mario endings (both when the game finishes and in the gallery) now with a black screen with information about it. Pressing space or clicking on the button will start it.
- Gallery no more 'free' for use (spoiling buttons). But you can still make them appear if you activate the cheat combination when Peach is in Worldmap or in a given level). Remember you will be spoiling yourself. New scenes are first put in the levels, then later or much later they are put in the gallery anyway.
- Peach can now RUN while in the worldmap.
- Peach will no more gets locked up when dancing (if she is a nymph already). The player can quickly 'wake her up' before she is abused by any nearby enemy.
- Peach will now only talk once with Yoshi. New meetings will make us select what we want directly.
- Peach will masturbate her butt while standing in backside view if she's horny or already a nymph
- Added SPLASH sound when Peach touches the water.
- Options menu now accessible in the Character Select screen.
- Added a new option: 'Tender Vore Scenes' - (YES/NO)
- BUG fix: giant pause menu (when pressing CTRL) in Star Hill level (world 4).
- BUG fix: Bub-ulber walking even during the dialog, making Peach disappear in his sniffing scene.
- BUG fix: Boss Bass were taking Peach right after leaving the pipe, throwing a double Peach bug. HAVE TO TEST!
- Glitch Fix: When using some doors, Peach was still leaving it non invulnerable. Peach needs to be invulnerable for a bit to avoid sneaky/cheap scenes with a nearby enemy.
- Glitch Fix: yet some showers weren't cleaning her arms (no option to do it).
- Glitch Fix: when sitting on the throne, if horny bar was full and Peach went out of it, she cummed immediatelly but she lost the interaction with all buttons of the level.
- Glitch Fix: 'auto drop veggie if she is almost falling' REMOVED, it was throwing bugs. Now she wont drop the veggie.
- Glitch Fix: removed 24 strange overlapping coins in 1-3, next to the fireflower, and another 24 coins next to the Jelektros.
- Glitch Fix: 'Start' button for some endings not appearing. Now he name 'Start' will be there to make it more clear.
- Glitch Fix: 'Default Settings' in options menu wasn't working well.
- Glitch Fix: Goomba Missionary scene was not arousing Peach.
- Glitch Fix: while being a raccoon/leaf, if the player walks/runs with Peach then use her tail to float (default X button), Peach was not falling with the correct pose.
- Glitch Fix: Wrong Toad type (not being a guard anymore) if a guard fucks Peach from behind (when she's horny or a nymph).
- Cosmetic changes, like Cherbil returning to its original shape (rounder) and small change to jump animation (she wont be 'jumping in place' in certain situations like when she is embarrassed).

Update 2.1.1 (29 january 2014)
- NEW: Boss Bass scene 2 and 3 by me. Added BossBass to the gallery.
- NEW: Added Boss Bass hentai picture by Shax (try to unlock it).
- NEW: Chain Chomp scene 5 by me.
- NEW: Pink female yoshi added. So far, she will appear only in certain areas, like the Yoshi House or Toad Town. Peach will be able to mount on her too.
- NEW: Water area in level 1-4. Try to find it.
- NEW: Peach will now masturbate in the vine/ladder if she stops climbing while horny enough.
- NEW: Peach can enter inside her carriage (if its there), in Peach's Castle main patio.
- NEW: Yet two new Boggly Tree rooms (level 4-4) with something happening there. Try to find out.
- Improved Goomba Scene 1. Now she will be stunned/amazed by his dick and wondering if she will really play with it.
- Improved Characters in character select screen: Peach/Daisy/Rosalina are now vectorized (mostly was done manually by me).
- Improved Toad scene 13th by Blargh.
- Yet Another improvement to her butt. Now its symmetric and more 'bubble' like.
- Title buttons: now its Play! instead of 'New Game'. 'Load Game' is placed in the character select screen.
- Yoshi can now jump (Jump key), attack (attack key, 'Z' button), and Peach will tease herself if mounted for so long. The idea is NOT to reproduce ALL Yoshi movements like the ability to fly, spit fireballs or enter on pipes, for example, but to fulfill our fantasies (like making her fuck him while mounted and ride while cumming). Yoshi still doesnt 'flee' if Peach is attacked but this feature is planned. I also plan making him 'gulp' enemies.
- Added Yoshi to two other level areas (try to find him). 
- Added hot 'scent' / 'smoke' cum effect in certain scenes and in the puddle of cum. 
- Improved the 'double cherry' from SMW. Its not the 'blue one' (to be done later or much later), which would duplicate Peach. So it might activate a Peach-Peach sex scene, but no double Peach walk, as its not the intent of this game to replicate everything.
- Glitch Fix: Peach was standing up in the opposite direction in certain scenes.
- Glitch Fix: Peach will no more activate dialogues (by pressing UP) if the creature touches Peach while she is climbing a vine, ladder, etc already.
- Glitch Fix: Level 1-1, 4-4 and maybe other levels slower due to tree folliages from Playshapes with shadows and excess points. (tech info: now, 'bitmap M' mode is ON).
- Glitch Fix (NEEDS TO TEST MORE): Piranha plants in some levels werent making Peach invulnerable after the scene (causing scene-after-scene rush). And piranhas weren't being blocked if Peach is over them before they raise up.
- Glitch Fix: Peach was starting the game with lingerie only, even if the player loaded a save file already full clothed then going to Peach's Castle.
- Glitch Fix: When loading a saved game in the title screen or character select screen, where Peach was 'Leaf', but clothed, Peach was appearing naked in the worldmap.
- Glitch Fix: in certain circunstances when you configured a custom oufit, like Peachy Racer for the 'Dress' powerup, taking the Leaf powerup would make her without ears, and odd problems occurred in other custom outfits like Raccoon, Tigeress and Yoshi. The problem is, those cant receive ears and a raccoon tail at all (why having a raccoon tail and a tigeress tail at the same time?), so those will now force Peach to be a 'naked raccoon'.
- Bug Fix: Peach always walking while facing right in the worldmap, if she has a skirt/dress on. (tech info: 'on action' not being off forcedly after circle fade out mechanism).
- Bug Fix: Chompette was not doing her 3rd action/scene.
- Bug Fix: Peach's tail disappearing when breaking blocks, in case she is a 'partial raccoon' (she used the Leaf).
- Bug Fix: some foreground folliage in level 4-4 were not moving with Peach when she is near them in perspective.
- Cosmetic improvements to graphics, like the addon of the 'small ice-cream-like blue mushroom bush' (you can see them in Toad Town and Yoshi House), the blue stairs of Sir Grodus lounge area, and now Mario 'looks down' in his SMB ending. Adjusted Peach face position while embarrassed (frontside view).

Update 2.1 (10 january 2014)
- NEW: two hands: 'grabbing tenderly' and 'open palm', to be used in certain circunstances.
- NEW: Mario frontside face (For later. Not visible in the game just yet)
- NEW Mario Action: 'whawhawhawha' or 'wowowowo' (scared) from Paper Mario 2. (For later. Not visible in the game just yet)
- NEW ENDING: Super Mario RPG. Already in the gallery. But of course, it's advised to see it after beating the game or you will spoil yourself.
- NEW: Puddle of cum. Beware of those! If Peach walks over it, she will fall and get drenched!
- NEW! YOSHI: Peach can talk to him and ride him! Jumping with Yoshi not yet supported. Yoshi is planned to be found in some levels, by breaking an egg (in certain blocks) or he will be just lounging there. Peach will be able to use him to trespass some obstacles as spikes and fire, as he has boots. But you will be able to skip him to avoid the dick rubbing her and/or fucking her holes. Which hole the 'secure saddle dick' will screw her up is up to your imagination, but its mostly anal to preserve her virginity, if any.
- NEW Character Select Screen with new Peach art by TheDirtyMonkey! You will select which character you will play in the entire game. You wont be able to change characters during gameplay anymore, as this was made only for testing. In 'FREE MODE' (in the future), you might be able to get to this screen in a click of a button.
- NEW: Peach can now break blocks using her tail attack or by hitting them with veggies.
- NEW optional buttons: DROP crown and DROP earrings in 'Outfit Room' screen. Peach then will be removing them by herself. Nice to make Peach fell really stark naked. Once dropped, you need to get another powerup or lose a life to find another crown/earrings.
- NEW: 3 (or more) different Peach stats in the end level screen, depending on her status (horny, clothed, etc). Added 'Peach waving the hand' pose.
- NEW accessible area: Yoshi House (in worldmap1) and Super Mario RPG toad house (in level 4-3).

- NEW: Peach's Cake (In her castle). But it will appear only from time to time (Zess T uses to cook it). No scenes yet but Peach can interact with it.
- NEW: 2 toad scenes by Blargh! Remember Peach would have access to more scenes if she is horny enough, drunk or already a nymph.
- NEW: 3 Piranha scenes (finally!). No  vaginal scenes, and some tentacle's may not go deep in her ass in a way we can see clearly, so its up to your imagination.
- NEW: Peach Embarrassed art by TheDirtyMonkey. To see it, try to leave Peach's castle naked or bottomless.
- NEW: Zess T kitchen scene by Toyloli! Check it out in Peach's castle. 
- NEW: Bamboo Broom object (Peach can interact with it, depending on her state). You can find it in her castle and in a given forest level.
- NEW: Peach can sit in her dinner throne now (in her castle).
- NEW area of level 4-4 (Boggly Tree).
- NEW: 'Common puny' with 1 sexual scene (the common people of Boggly tree, with yellow antenae). There are some groups of them scatered in some areas. The idea is to make them fiddle with Peach if Peach passes over them while horny (it will happen automatically), or if she talks to them and asks for it (the player will force it). 
- ADDED Toad Guards to Peach's castle, with new clothes and a spear.
- ADDED new 'mouth style': tongue up/down'. You will see that improvement in scenes like bobomb scene 5, chomp scene 4 and other scenes.

- IMPROVED Peach lips while side facing. Thanks QuisMasterBos!
- IMPROVED vegetables/item grabbing. Now, if Peach passes over it, a message says you can grab it, pressing UP.
- Toads might detect if Peach is dressed as Mario, depending on their assumptions.
- Yux can be hit now (he will be dizzy for some seconds, he wont be knocked out, beware!). Some sexual sounds added.
- Red Yux will go away if Peach enters in Grodus's room, so she can leave the room safely.
- Added some piranhas to level 1-2.
- Inverted 'Toad' and 'Friend' buttons in the gallery, and added a mushroom roof graphic to the button.
- Exchanged Peach words (dialogue balloons) during Mushroom Big scene 2.
- Increased invulnerability time (between 3 and 4 seconds) because, in certain circustaintes, Peach was getting into certain scenes like with Piranha plants sooner.
- Bug Fix: Some later toad scenes (10,11,12,13) were locking Peach's movement up, and shredding Peach's skirt (only 13 could do that).
- Bug FIx: Fized placement problems with her breasts and arms while grabbing vegetables with a highest boob size.
- Bug Fix: earrings not being put again when Peach was taking a new powerup.
- Glitch Fix: now, clothes will be shredding with some animation (bra, skirt/dress and vest).

- NEW: Added Daisy as a NPC in her palace (level 2-7). But no scenes yet. She should be able to talk, walk, and remove her clothes in the future. If Peach is already a "Daisy', the real Daisy wont appear there. In the future, the player will be able to change his/her characters only in the beginning of the game, so ignore the fact you can change to Daisy while looking at the real Daisy (she wont disappear that way, but again, its not a bug, its due to the ability to change characters at any time).

- In 'lonely dialogues' (those Peach talks once) you can press JUMP key to skip it too, aside of SPACE.
- Glitch Fix: the clothing piles work correctly now (at least in the checkpoint showers). E.g. If Peach is barenaked (with shoes only), those will appear on the floor when she goes to take a bath.
- Bug Fix: During Morton and Larry scenes, sometimes Peach 'could die' (pressing DEL key). During Boss scenes, that can't happen.

- Bug Fix: Peach no more goes through certain locked doors in level 2-3 and 2-5 when she 'runs at top speed' on them, even without the key.

Update 2.0.13: (23th september 2013)
- A stampede of a Bub-bulber scene, two new Cheep Cheep scenes, one Birdo scene, SIX new shyguy scenes (3rd moved to 5th. Added 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th) and a new goomba scene by me (its now placed after the first vaginal scene). Ideas from ThatGuy45. Remember that you can only knock Birdo down avoiding the scene if you jump on her egg first, then grab it (RUN key), and throw at her.
- Added date and time on each saved game.
- Wigglers can now be stomped.
- Added a sound box indicating straight pipes are accessed pressing DOWN (or UP in the case of upside-down pipes) on level 1-1.
- Added some gloryholes in certain trees along some levels (search for them)! A pink button might appear and Peach can swallow it, like in her closet (Peach's Castle).
- Her pink dress in 9-3 was changed to a place she could use it (one of the lockers are now opened, without a door, showing the dress).
- Now you can clean Peach body areas immediatelly (stain by stain) by pressing each button. So if her face is full of cum, pressing up to 5 times will clean her up without having to wait her washing her head slowly.
- Now you can 'Clean Cum when Level ends' automatically, going to the options menu.
- Performance improvement in 1-3, mostly with Boss Bass and Blooper code.
- Performance improvement due to 'less camera-near check code' for objects that can be spared (not being drawn). The problem is that too many objects that needs to 'disappear' to save performance will, on the contrary, increase LAG and CPU usage because there will be so many check code as well. The code was also optimized with the separated 'Init' function. Also, fences are vectors again (like in level 1-3).

- Glitch Fix: even without any sound/music on, some hittable block sounds were being cast.
- Glitch Fix: huge textballoon from Toadette (in Peach Castle).

are far away from Peach, they disappear forever, destroying the 'Its still there waiting for me!' syndrome.
- Glitch Fix: checkpoint flags no more lock themselves up (without showing the cleaning balloon) when a dirty Peach touches it more than once.
- Glitch Fix: some imperfections in a given bonus room, and added an 1up there.
- Glitch Fix: A swimming toad in Toadella's bath (Peach's Castle) were on top of her dialogue balloon.
- Visual Fix: In 1-1, blue mountain no more 'non attached' to the ground, beside blue mushroom mountains. Also, removed 3 mushroom 'caps' in - - Glitch Fix: Peach was dying (by pressing DEL) in levels she couldnt do that (like x-naut level) and in certain situations (during scenes).
the lower room area.
- Glitch Fix: Sometimes Peach was still retaining her old situation (e.g. being naked even after taking a new powerup), having to press jump or other key to 'update' her manually.
- Glitch Fix: now , inventory items save and load correctly
- Glitch Fix: Weird skirt appearing in the last chomp scene.
- Glitch Fix: You cant exit the level during a given action (e.g. a goomba scene in front of the keep door) of when pressing 'UP' to go back to worldmap while in the pause menu.
- Glitch Fix: Legs not being clean when pressing 'legs' button in the showers.

- BUG Fix: certain invisible blocks on level 2-1 (in those floating wooden block rooms)

- Bug Fix: Peach could be able to leave water area in the secret pipe area underwater in 1-3, and she could leave the 'sky' in 3-2 (cloud area with a '?' block and the large golden block corridor). Some of them also threw 'a blue screen of camera death'.

- Bug Fix: When Peach were crouching next to moving platforms (like 1-5) they were stopping the movement!
- WORKAROUND: Stronger 'anti Blue screen' algorithm. If it occurs in some places, at least you can now force Peach to die (DEL button) and the camera should be ok again.

Update 2.0.10: (23th july 2013)
- Peach Castle -> vegetable bowl and improved dinner Table and plates.
- Peach Castle -> Improved Peach Tower (by ToyLoli)
- Peach Castle -> Zess T. is now in the kitchen but no apron scene yet.
- Peach Castle - New: added CHOMPETTE (in the roof). No scenes yet, but she has AI inside (she looks at you, she faces you when you pass by, she 'cums' from her mouth when she wants...)
- New: added Rosalina as a playable character.
- New: you will be notified if Peach is not a virgin anymore (Art by Jive Guru, thank you)!
- New: Improved code for toads (you can talk to a walking/jumping toad (pressing UP or clicking on the button) and some of the other toads. Soon, all balloons of text will be changed to messagebox mode. Its more optimized, and Peach can interact with them better, without the balloon overlapping Peach. Except for other toads (1-3 and grey castle ones)
- New: 'outfit items' DRESS and APRON in Peach Castle: you can wear it, put in your inventory (if the clothing is compatible with this), or skip its usage. The plan is to have more of these outfit items scattered through levels and special dwellings.
- New Bobomb Sex scene (also added to the gallery, like the two x-naut ones).
- New Chain Chomp Sex scene (same as above).
- Added 'ponytail cum' feature and adjusted 'head cum'.

- Glitch fix: sometimes (like in Charlieton Scene) the button could appear even if Peach is far from him.
- Glitch fix: persisting sound cuts, like when Peach go into her bath while keeping the jumps. Some splash sounds didnt return once played. TECH INFO: '_root.SOUNDXX.stop()' doesnt work well. It stops other sounds too. Use _root.SOUNDXX=false;
- Glitch fix: persisting old problem with music not being played after P-power block effects wearing out while you're inside a special room (like under the pipe). TECH INFO: special areas cant be checked if equal or not to musicToPlay to avoid music restart if its the same value, because this will impact P-power.
- Glitch fix: characters (like Charlieton and Bubulber) were moving in small steps/offsets at each dialog interaction. This was more problematic in non walking characters like Osama (this glitch was better seen after the improved Osama dialogue above).

- Improved Peach expressions when she talks with herself (like in the beginning).
- Improved Grodus Lounge area. Now we can search for the disk shelves.
- Improved Peach cum algorithm and relocation of cum variable as global. This might also fix a bug in 9-3 (X-naut PHD still detecting Peach invisible, even without any floating cum).

- Bug Fix: Peach wasnt embarrassed anymore on version 2.0.7 due to a conflict.

- NEW: Worldmap 9 (overworld) with moon textures and new music. Save/Load games work there.
- ADDED enemies to the dusk/shadowy toad house (Toad Town). 'Shadowy' scenes are seen in an unicque way with common enemies. However, these wont be triggered all the time, because there will be making up and slow sex scenes by a shadow friend of Peach. Those enemies will still appear, in certain circunstances, like when she goes inside the house without being invited by that shadow friend, or when the shadow friend isn't there (e.g. a sign: 'Away' in the door). Thats because the right door inside is unprotected, and enemies invade there often when the friend isn't there.
- ADDED 'Toadette talking' scene, in Peach's Castle (when Peach is dressed and touches her).

- Rule changes: Peach cant lose a life anymore (pressing DEL) if she's into interactive scenes like the toilet, the throne and the bed, as well as entire levels like 9-1. Actually, DEL keypress should disappear sooner or later, because the solely purpose was to be a 'panic button' in situations Peach can be locked up. Since this is a rare occurrence and we can load a saved game, DEL usage can end up vanished.
- Rule changes: spikes wont be making Peach lose a life instantly anymore (except if she's on peril - naked and zero horniness).

- Glitch fix: FPS option wasnt working

To cancel the level, you have to either load a saved game, or to use a cheat (not recommended, as it will remove bonus and coins), so be aware you have to finish the tasks in 9-1 once there.

-Now, a messagebox appears in worldmap to inform Peach of achievements. E.g: Peach will say she now needs to go to the bunker with the key. This will help the players direct themselves to the next task.
- Peach can now kill enemies just passing over them, while using starman (except bloopers, piranha plants and sparklies).

- BUG FIX: Peach/Fire Peach feet with strange black stains near her nails (augmented outline bug).

- Bug Fix: Peach would lock herself up when taking the key while jumping and running at the same time.
- Bug Fix: If the player clicked the blue button to start a conversation (instead of pressing "up") with the toads of 1-2, they would keep talking with the player again and again (a deadlock).
- Bug Fix: After peach lactates, her speed remained the same (a crawl), no matter how many mushrooms she ate.

- BUG FIX: In some areas, camera was 'going up' inadvertently. More tests needed.

Update 1.9 (17th february 2013)
- NEW: third improvement to camera code. The game is a bit faster (less CPU usage). Movement like Peach jumping is noticeable (more smooth). Also, added 'boundary-check-boundary' using trigonometry, making warps smoother without camera glitches, like the camera being blocked in ghost doors of level 2-4, forcing Peach to walk until the edge of the screen to unlock it. 
- Now, the fade in camera when going from worldmap to a normal level will aim the circle right on Peach, like SMB3.
- NEW: Now Peach gets some invencibility (invulnerability/blinking) after each scene. This gives the player some opportunity to flee if there are tons of enemies. However, if her horny bar is more than half, the protection will wear off faster (PS: in later updates, I removed the 'horny bar' check because Peach was getting normal again too soon after piranha scenes).
- NEW: independent backgrounds with movement on level 1-1, 1-2, 1-4 and grey castle (1-6). You will notice the difference while walking. Fixed some bugs with some level starts (Like 1-2), where the background were placed wrongly.

- BUG fix: a persisting bug in some doors and the bonus toad house door, making Peach go out of it (UP key) without being in the front of the door.
- BUG fix: Peach wasnt going inside some vases (blue screen)

- NEW: Level 3-4 is playable
- NEW: Apron outfit by Luftmallow, improved a bit by me. Added to the game and working.

- Some AZERTY keys fixed and removed 'X' from the keyboard menu in OPTION 4 (SINGLE LEFT HAND). You can use SHIFT to run AND to go to the next scene.
- Improved Peach jumping animation (clothing movement)
- New camera reposition. Now, we can see more areas under Peach. It will help on levels like 1-5, 3-2, 3-4 and others.

- Improved block collision when Peach hits them.
- Bug Fixed: Peach freezing/disappearing while making sex with Bloopers (mostly when the player goes to pause menu during the scene)
- Bug possible Fixed: Peach was freezing/disappearing while fucking 'hard sleep' goombas (mostly when the player goes to pause menu during the scene)
- Bug possible Fixed: Level 2, when finished, was activating levels 3 and 4. Level 4 was activating levels 5 and 6.
- Bug possible Fixed: Sometimes two phantos were appearing on 2-4 level. Going into a white door while Phanto touches Peach locks Peach up. And Peach was having two sounds and her animation being locked as long as Phanto was touching her.
- Bug Fixed: Ghost coin in coinboxes
- Bug Fixed: Peach breaking more than one block, and even when falling, while underwater.
- Bug Fixed: 'semi LALEM bug' in level 3-4 (Level after Level mangling), a problem with Flash engine itself involving levels with hundreds of objects. Once you finish the level, further levels carries objects from the former level. Fixed.
- Bug Fixed: 'song changes' inside some buildings are not duplicating/reseting/playing the wrong one anymore (but P-button music while going ouside vases or when Peach dies still needs to be checked).
- Bug Fixed: Finally, the 'third boob' problem in the threesome scene of koopas.
- Bug Fixed: on rare occasions (mostly in slower computers, like Pentium4 single core and earlier), Peach was being locked up in the red pipe of the worldmap, when the player makes her walk then press space to read her dialogue about the pipe.
- Glitch Fixed: wrong layering in platforms and embarrassed mountains in the worlmap of world1.
- Glitch Fixed: clothing layers during jumps and descends.
- Just a notice: the Bras of the apron outfit is really supposed to be 'open' in the bottom area, as they have a thin layer of tissue there.
- (internal): Improved layer MC in some levels (turned into Graphic and 'group' symbols) and PIPES are now in the main layer instead of _ground (more game speed and easier for me to update/add pipes).
- (internal): next step of 'Peach state machine code' is done. Now I use 'set variables' before activating each pose. If Peach is, say, not walking, the game wont be calling for the 'waiting' pose all the time. For the player, the change is unnoticeable, but the game is now a bit faster.

- BUG FIX: 'LEGOB': Level Going Back without player consent. A TOUGH bug that lasted more than 2 days of intense programming and chasing.
- BUG FIX: Peach was getting engulfed in quicksands with strong speed.
- (internal code) - using jump_pressed=false in every jump action instead of auto-jump_pressed in the end of game loop. 'Grav<8' trick added to make Peach jump correctly if she's falling 'a bit' with structures like lumbers or when she's climbing slopes or in the edge of blocks (about to fall).
- (internal) - ADDED BOWSER JR (but no scenes yet and he doesnt appear in the game yet)
- Recolor of Bowser (more vivid color), also to be compatible with Bowser JR color.

Update 1.8.14 (29th january 2013)
-NEW: Bobombs are more alive. They can walk freely or just run and explode, and they can follow Peach! Now, they will explode anytime they want, be it with Peach touching them or not. In airship levels, some cannons also spawn Bobombs.
-NEW: Three inner toad houses in Village area
-NEW: Charlieton in Village area (no dialog yet).
-NEW: Village/market area with a new song. You can explore there but nothing much to do yet.
-World3 is now accessible. You can program the computer in the bunker to go to World2 or World3 (in the future, all worlds). Of course, you have to finish world2 first. You can also use the pipe in world3 to return. No levels yet.
-Tail attack completed (like fireballs, veggies and pow blocks, it will knock out/pop out enemies). For shyguys, bobombs, goomba, koopas and pokeys so far. It uses RUN KEY, so if you are using raccoon/leaf power, you have to keep run key pressed to avoid using tail attack while running (just like Mario Bros 3).
-The Koopaling Larry is now in airship1 (alive animation, but not sex scenes yet) and Morton in airship2.
-Improved FPS benchmark (in options menu). Its more consistent now. Thanks to coolness32.
-Improved vegetables/pow block throwing (they will travel a bit farther).
-(internal): changes to screens like endings, the end, keyboard layout, load game... Now, all different screen areas are contained in just one.
-Some graphical adjustments to toad houses.
-Song of Worldmap1 reverted back to the original (SMB3).
-Song of Grey Castles reverted back to 'bowser keep' theme (less frightening than SMW song).
-Pokeys: now, fireballs/veggies/stomping will remove his parts. If pokey touches Peach, she will be harmed. If Peach stomps on his last part (head), he will be popped out. But beware! Pokeys will be invencible for a bit when harmed. No sex scenes yet.
-Improved start screen title. It was with wrong color.
-Added 'master hands' to be 'claws' of E.gadd lab. Its better for Peach not to touch the buttons. But no scenes yet.
-NOTICE! Its not more possible to quick start a level in LOAD/GO menu (right area). This is considered cheating and renders areas like pipes that lead back to World1 useless! If you enable the cheat, it will be there again, though, but remember you will lose bonus points, coins, special scenes, etc.
-Black screen filter is added to people who plays in full screen in widescreen monitors. So you can now play maximized (if you have a good computer like a Core i7) without artifacts
-BUG FIX: links in the title menu (gallery, achievements, credits, etc) were not working
-BUG FIX: bobomb messages, like 'press do-over key ...explosion' while still making sex. This message should appear only after the scene.
-BUG FIX: Game Over was broken.

Update 1.8.13 (27th january 2013)
- NEW: Improved title screen text (unicque Peach font made by people on LOK)
- NEW: Fireballs and veggies now 'kill' (pops out) goombas, koopas and shyguys. BOBOMBS/SPARKS not yet supported!
- NEW: POW BLOCK. You will find it in some levels. Once Peach grabs it and throws it, it will pop out any nearby enemy instantly.
- NEW: E.gadd lab is accessible! Its next to the market, in Peach Castle area. You can go there and even press a button. No scenes yet. Soon, you will be able to take the spaceship to the moon.
- NEW: SAVE/LOAD game buttons are now accessible from the worldmap too.
- NEW: six new toad houses made by me. You can see them around levels of world1 and in Toad Bonus level.
- NEW: Peach now needs to go inside the bunker to retrieve coordinates in order to spawn the cannon to go to World2. Just press 'SPACE' in the 'bunker' level hole in the worldmap after beating the first airship (Osama Palace area).
- Cheat code key changed. Refer to the 'IMPORTANT INFO' section here in this page.
- Graphics: improved pugdy cannons (in airship levels) and the cannon itself (that big one used to send Peach to world2). As for cannon balls, they fly a bit slower and Peach will bounce up if she jumps on them.
- Added Phanto instead of shyguys in the vases with keys in world 2 levels.
- BUG FIX in one of the rocky doors of level 2-4 and 2-1, where Peach was being able to go up in the confined inner squares (wooden blocks).
- BUG FIX: The 'PRESS SPA' problem.
- BUG FIX: 'double key' problem when she grabs the key in squatting position.
- BUG FIX: Red platforms weren't trembling/falling if Peach has stopped there while in backside view. This bug happened in the past but now the problem was in another code area.
- BUG FIX: Peach sound while underwater (bubbles) is also there if she's without any powerup.
- BUG FIX: 'Peach petrified problem' when she jumps while taking some powerups. BUT MORE TESTS NEEDED.
- BUG FIX: strange white rectangle in the end of airship2.
- BUG FIX: Peach no more locks up if she enters a door while an enemy touches her.
- BUG FIX in certain areas where you go to the gallery in-game, then Peach was being invisible/duplicated. More tests needed.

- BUG FIX: Now, if Peach get her bottoms shred, 'thongs' or 'strange cloth parts' wont appear anymore.
- BUG FIX: Her back torso is fixed when she enters the Ghost Doors (in grey castles).
- BUG FIX: Being 'Fire Peach' (ebony character), the 3rd blooper scene was making her left arm with vanilla color
- BUG FIX: A wall in the underground bonus area in 2-1 were making Peach warp to oblivion (outside stage).
- Adjusted END of AUTO MOVE camera in airships. Now, if Peach reaches the pipe, the camera will stop.
- Adjusted some blocks in level 2-1 and 2-4 (inside the pyramid), closed a gap in some woody blocks, moved a pokey and a checkpoint in 2-1, moved a pokey after tomb area of 2-5 and increased ceiling height in the start of 2-5 (vases area).
- Thwomps now cast EARTHQUAKES when landing on the floor.
- Keys: now, enemies will DROP the key if Peach stomps/uses POW BLOCK/makes sex with them. So she need to...you know..stick the key in a safe place in order to find the right door.
- Improved Peach collisions in order to make enemies/projectiles touch her 'more deeper' in order to hurt her. Also, to make her fly without making her head trespass some blocks, but more testing needed.
- Changed fireflower placement, because there were two blocks next to one another in the grey castle (2-4).
- Thwomps now stay shorter in the ground.
- Tiggling sound (when peach is running) volume was lowered.
- Improved collision in quicksands to make Peach go down further before losing a life.
- (Internal) Improved cheep cheeps. Now, they fall 'upside down' when stomped. And now, they can return if Peach stays in that area for so long.
- Poison Mushroom now walks slower underwater.
- Improved LOAD/SAVE game mechanism. Now, the list of immediate levels (right side of LOAD screen) is now working. Just click in one of them (if active - in blue).

Update 1.8.12 (20th january 2013)
- Peach now walks grabbing her dress in the worldmap and she walks faster there (the intention of the worldmap is to have quick access to levels)
- Added an underground pipe area to go back to World1. Its in the worldmap 2. The plan is to have one of those pipes in each worldmap but world1.
- (Internal) Added 'worldmap 3' area but not yet playable.
- BUG FIX: Peach sometimes were going out of pipes while backside mode and not being able to walk (level 1-2 and Airship 2).
- Peach no more takes a vegetable while running. This can be annoying sometimes.
- Peach now exchanges clothes correctly if she's walking while taking a given powerup.
- Some more bug fixes and some code optimization.
- Cosmetic change to 1-2 (underground).

Update 1.8.11 (16th january 2013)
- NEW: Level 2-6, Daisy Castle and Level 2-7 (airship). All are now playable. Idea and sketch of 2-6 by Quiz! Thank you!
Daisy and Iggy koopa may come later, but with no scenes (I still need to make a scene with him).
- NEW: New start area of Level 1-1 (mushroom houses, trees and relocation of some toads and blocks, because Peach Castle is now a bit farther), and two BRIDGES on level 1-1 (can you find them)?
- NEW: Morton now 'breathes' (he's alive) and you can ZOOM the scene with him, clicking on him/on Peach, during their scene in the airship.
- NEW enemy: ANGRY SUN. Its on level 2-6. He does not hurt Peach but he may remove some clothes. The idea is to make some scenes later with him.
- NEW: Cloud 'family' (in the sky) and some mountains now blushes if Peach is naked or half naked.
- NEW: Installation of 2 pipes in the worldmaps, but they are not working yet. The plan is to make a one-way pipe, from the worldmaps of later worlds back to wordmap of world1. Why not a 'duplex'? Because the Castle pipe receives all other pipes, like a central point. Peach will get lost if she try to get back, like in a whirlpool. So Peach will have to use the cannon again. I may even make that area later (a kind of 'pipe level') just for fun, maybe with a given scene or her being locked in the pipes, to show that Peach will get lost or in trouble in all situations.
- Worldmap 1: path relocation. now, its more linear.
- Mario castles: now, every start of the world (x-1) and the level before grey castle (usually x-5 or x-6) will have a large Mario castle. Other levels will have the small Mario castle.
- Improved water algorithm and climbing algorithm (again). Now, no more 2 collision objects (only one). Peach is now able to jump out of the water smoothly (like on levels 2-2 and 2-6), and she can jump better while climbing.
- Masturbation key is still V, but DO-OVER key is now 'A', in 'RIGHT handed keyboard config' (option 1). This solves the problem of do over with masturbation at the same time.
- New keypress: "G" to go to the gallery immediatelly. "G" again to left it. "Ctrl" will go back to pause menu.
- Improved soundbox (info) block: Now, the dialog will only activate when Peach finishes her jump.
- Improved running when going down slopes, and now Peach will try to fly (arms open) when you jump while all arrows are red (but she will only fly if she's a raccoon/semi raccon, of course)
- Adjusted the ladder of level 2-3 (Peach might be having a hard time climbing there).
- Changed Toadsworth room dialog when Peach enters his room.
- Improved Peach descending in the sky, after beating airship. She should be descending slower due to Perry (her umbrella).
- (internal): now, the palaces (before airships) are READY to have custom backgrounds and custom characters. That is, at each palace (world 1 to 7) I will be using optimized objects that lead to a faster game.
- (internal): update to dialog algorithm (mostly those who appear when Peach enters the nursery room and toadsworth room), but I may create 'functions of logic' soon, like some code used in LISP, to deal with decisions and 'IF's better.
- Bug Fix: Peach blushing wasnt working well since earlier versions due to hidden conflict. Created _restore and _save function to deal with that better , while in character select screen.
- Bug Fix: strange invisible walls blocking the inner brick areas on level 2-1 now removed.
- Bug Fix: now, Peach will pause (even if falling or in the water) if you go to the pause / info /character select menu.
- Bug Fix: Peach being locked up after sex with the hard sleeping goomba of 1-1. Solved.
- Bug Fix: Once Peach grabbed the red mushroom (mushroom ring), Peach was not being able to jump or go down (by gravity) after taking another powerup like Flower.
- Bug Fixe and adjustments to some buttons in gallery area, and now the buttons SKIP/BACK of the endings are returning to proper places.
- Bug Fix to the backside thigh pantyhose when Peach is using Daisy outfit (it should be with the same color as the leg area). Also, Daisy Striker top is now on Peach body when she is facing backside.
- Small fix: SINGLE RIGHT HAND name was changed to RIGHT HANDED and vice versa.
- Bug Fix to SINGLE RIGHT HAND (option2): Raccoon Peach was getting into a Statue when going left. Also, correction to 'Z' key involving RIGHT HANDED.
- Improvement to coinboxes (they may not freeze anymore in certain situations) but more tests needed. Please reinforce that bug if they keep appearing.
- Small glitch fix in the character select screen. When changing character types, fire Peach was appearing with wrong earring and crown styles/colors.

Update 1.8.10 (13th january 2013)
-(internal): improved Peach object placement (_root.char.character vanished), so the game may be faster 1 to 2%
-Improved level 1-1 (again) with more toad house styles/colors and some arrangements
-NEW: keyboard option 2 is now 'SINGLE RIGHT HAND'.
-Changed keys of 'single right hand': U is 'up, climb', I is JUMP, ; (semicollon) is RUN. Thats a better configuration.
-NEW area: Peach castle 'campus' in left area of worldmap - world1. Those blue levels holes (except P) are only placeholders.
-NEW: added Bunker (first version) and Peach castle building (art by Soloid, arrangement by me) in the campus area. Peach castle will remain with that color from SM RPG (maintaining MIM concepts). Added cosmetic objects (trees, flowers, yoshi).
-NEW: Peach now sleeps if you let her stood up for so long.
-Feature: Phanto now moves! But MORE TESTING NEEDED. He appears only in level 2-5. The plan is to make him appear more in world 3 (subcon world) and maybe in a given bonus area in world1. No scenes yet. Phanto is supposed to shred Peach clothes and let her hornier and hornier.
-Feature: now, when you left Peach castle, you go right to worldmap.
-Feature: Peach, while using striker outfits, will have a shorter hair. But beware! If she's stark naked again, the hair will be back to normal.
Thats because Peach 'does her makeup and hair' while in those outfits, for sport events only. IDEA BY Biles! Thanks.
-Feature: mushroom mountains in the end level stats will blush if Peach is exposed (e.g. bottomless)
-Feature: now, when you beat the airship and falls to the palace, Peach goes (or at least SHOULD go) to her castle, in worldmap. If Peach walks to other levels, a message will remind the player Peach needs to give the key to activate the cannon.
-Feature: Peach now stays full of cum if the bobomb explodes on her
-Improvement: new blocks - info soundbox and happy cloud (by Biles)
-Improvement: green blocks in level 1-3 are now bitmaps. You will not notice pixelation and the level is now faster (less CPU intensive).
-Bug Fix: backside thigh with stockings while using nurse dress (more tests needed)
-Bug Fix: musical blocks on level 2-1 (new algorithm): to jump higher, you have to keep pressed the jump key while the block is going down, then release it like a catapult.

-Bug Fix: Now Peach is getting full of cum when bobomb explodes

-Bug Fix: The game doesnt auto-scrolls anymore in the worldmap if you load a game while being in an auto scroll level (like 1-5 or 1-8).

- Level 2-5 is now playable! In the end of this level, it will have the same surprise. Phanto makes his first debut but he doesnt move yet.
- Some addons to 'inter level pictures' (the black screen with the next level to be played). It will show how the levels 2-2, 2-3, 2-4 and 2-5 will be.
- 4 More hands added! Total of 15 hands.
- New Peach animation: Squatting (to get the key). Just press 'grab vegetable key' (same as RUN key) when you're next to a given key.
- New Peach action: she can move straw blocks (level 2-5). Just press 'vegetable key'.
- Improved nipples (you will only see real changes zooming in, though)
- New improved graphics: VASE
- A better key design (now, her asshole will not suffer much).
- (INTERNAL): each level has an inner 'empty control frame' to avoid LALEM bug at any cost. You can search for 'lalem' in this forum if you dont know what it is.
- Bug Fix: sometimes, Peach when climbing couldn't jump when she's a full/semi racoon. Not anymore.
- Bug Fix: auto scroll camera was not stopping in Platty level, when Peach reached piranha pipe.
- Bug Fix: Peach was been locking up (not moving) when she grabbed any vegetable.
- Tiny bug fixes regarding messages, like 'press space to finish the level'.

Update 1.8.8 (24th december 2012)
- All 8 Peach hands were improved (remade). 3 new hands added, like ILY hand (but those are not in any Peach pose yet).
- Some adjustment to boundary limitations in some levels.
- Bug Fix regarding Peach being able to go past a roof wall, in level 1-1 (after going out of Peach castle), making Peach fall into oblivion.
- A few cosmetic changes too small to be noticed.

Update 1.8.7 (15th december 2012)
- New castle building: PALACE (in worldmap)
- New enemy: SPARKLY . You can see them in level 2-3, inside the pyramid. No sex scenes yet but beware! They will hurt Peach.
- New footstep sounds (without heels). Better and synchronized heels sound.
- New Peach poses: walking without dress and jaunting (when pressing RUN key).
- New: Improved camera code with 'independent boundaries group' technology, 'go-right-where-peach-is during warp' and 'correct stop with Math.floor' mechanism. It will limit level areas better. A bit more CPU performance is expected.
- More areas to explore in Level 2-3, with a locked door (you have to find a key to open it)
- (Internal) Enemies with same instance prefix and Enemies ability to open the rocky doors.
- Improved some Peach animations and some alignment to slopes. Little changes to Bra, Skirt and boobs placement in some poses.

Update 1.8.6 (10th december 2012)
- NEW: interactive buttons (no more 'blind searches' to objects). But there are just a few objects to interact. The majority of them is in X-naut level (secret world). I've also put this interactive button in a given object in level 1-1 and in a Peach's friend in level ??-?? (are you able to find it?)
- Bug FIX: In x-naut level, Peach was not interacting with TEC-XXX in the lab room, AFTER she sticks the Sir Grodus yellow disk. It should be fixed now, but more testing needed.
- Optimized Bonus level (Toad house) objects and SEVERE optimization to X-naut level objects, aligning some graphics too (x-naut level may be faster to the CPU now). I also prepared x-naut level in order to receive a new floor (ground one) with windows that show the moon's surface.
- Bug FIX: the doors that lead Peach back to Worldmap were not telling the message correctly (white line of text were being shown only after she passed across them).
- Bug FIX: a rare bug that makes Peach 'go into a door' (up button) even without a door nearby.

Update 1.8.5 (7th december 2012)
- Increased priority to optimize the game for SPEED (less CPU intensive) and GET RID of 'Level-after-Level Entire Mangling (LALEM)' BUG of Flash. MIM game will be able to have more levels using only one SWF. Planned size using the old 'optimized for size' SWF for a full game: 20mb (but impossible to achieve a 8-world game due to the LALEM problem). New planned size: 45mb (but POSSIBLE to achieve, using only one SWF). No one uses dial up connection those days anyway, and we have games like Paper Mario 2 that takes more than 1 gigabyte.
- Due to the above, I did a SEVERE optimization to 5 levels: Forest (1-2), Watery (1-3), Grey Castle (1-7), Desert II (2-2) and Desert III (2-3). (TECHNICAL) More than 2000 movie clips of background objects were converted to shape groups. Quality is practically the same. Levels are even faster to play (more CPU performance).
- New level: Second Grey Castle (2-4) in desert area. Soon, the Boos will interact with Peach.
- Finally, FIREWHEELS are easier now (they are now shorter).
- Improved Thwomp code
- New Peach outfit: SHADOW QUEEN (by me). This outfit is compatible with lingeries (black ones recommended)! But its gloves cannot be changed because its genuine to this outfit. Its NOT a special powerup yet.
- New Toad movement: 'jumping/bouncing'. You can see him inside Peach Castle.
- Remake of the remaining Mario parts and Remake of Grey Castle building (in worldmap).
- Improved all enemies code in regard to Peach detection. E.g. they will not 'work' or they will be lazy when they're far from Peach. Boos already have 'vision presence' code. This make NO damage to non-linear gameplay and unexpected actions.
- Improved level 1-1 to be even less CPU intensive (outside Peach castle). I'm now using a new approach to make levels and backgrounds (grouping-only objects instead of tons of movie clip 'tiled' objects).
- Cosmetic changes to objects (level 1 'mountains' have now black eyes, improved the 'bush with eyes', changes to some Peach body parts alignment and other tiny changes).
- Birdo is now a bit smaller in height.
- Bug FIX: when you press 'SAME COSTUME TO ALL', peach was not being invisible correctly in X-naut level.
- Bug FIX: Peach boobs went to default size after a load game. It was occurring in all load slots (testing needed).
- Bug FIX: LOAD game will now respect current Peach level (sometimes the next level hole, once active, was being deactivated again).
- Bug FIX (double song in the end of Watery level) - SOME TESTS STILL NEEDED.
- Bug FIX (Sex scenes were going to the end without the player pressing SPACE/SHIFT keys to advance each scene)
- Bug FIX (Button 'NEW GAME' were appearing in character select screen AFTER the game started. The correct is to make it appear only in PAUSE MENU).
- Bug FIX/REVISION (A problem with the vertical pipe in Watery level - Peach was struggling to enter it - again...) Problem may have arose again due to new rearrangement of Peach collision parts.

Update 1.8.4 (29th november 2012)
- Morton is now inside Airship level!
- Another boss in the grey castle (now, only a placeholder)
- New areas after beating Morton, with new music and effects. Then you need to bring the key to Toadsworth (Peach Castle). The key was not put in her ass yet.
- 'EXIT LEVEL' button vanished (when you replay an already finished level). Instead, you can finish a given level entering Mario Castle or going inside a 'white door' (like SMB2). They are placed in the beginning of some levels.
- "Camera focus with auto zoom" feature when Peach unlocks the cannon.
- "Camera focus with auto zoom" feature 2 (different engine from above) in certain areas, like the toad next to the Toad House outside Peach castle.
- Better scene with Toadsworth (blowjob - script by Quiz) and a new one (bed scene) but that's not yet complete!
- Level 2-3 is playable but not yet complete. Level 2-4 (castle two) is inside (INTERNAL) but not playable.
- BUG FIXES (12345...Populating list yet). Corrected 'third butt cheek' problem in some scenes; Peach was not being able to enter the second Toad House (coins area).
- Message text showing the player needs to press space (or shift, if keyboard config is 4) to skip a scene
- Bloppers can be skipped better when pressing space or shift
- COSMETIC: some more art were remade, like rocky door, mushroom mountains, underwater area, tree leaves and bushes.

Update 1.8.3 (21th november 2012)

- TESTING: new Peach mouth (kissing)

You cannot change it, but you can disable the glove upon selecting GLOVES: NONE in Character Screen, before grabbing the pill. This pill should not be so easy to find along the levels. Only in certain clinics (to be made), Bonus level (treasure chests) and Peach Castle.
- NEW: Toadsworth scene with a new dialog (right in the beginning). Peach no more sucks his dick right away. For that, go to Toadsworth room (downstairs).
- NEW: Blooper now wanders with tentacle animation (needs testing).
- Little change: Toadette is now outside Peach's closet.
- Improved Peach vest, skirt and body placement, boob graphics (rounder, done by pen tool) and improved Peach eyes (outline/lash and shadows when she blinks), hair outline color. Small change in Peach face ('top hair, not ponytail, was removed to give more consistency to perspective'). Better hair bang graphics.
- Adjustments to some peach animations, like drifting and flying, fixing some displacements.
- Toads' foot reverted back to older version (rounder), because its more adaptive to some poses. Also, a better hand for them.

- BUG FIX: Adjustments to Mario Ending 1, 2, 3 and Virgin Ending
- BUG FIX: Entering gallery in the game title screen and changing outfits, Peach will be with that outfit in title screen and/or when she's in her bed asking for Mario (needs more testing). Also, Peach no more becomes horny when the player sees the scene in the gallery (called from title screen), then start the game.
- Game source code (1.8.3, but a bit outdated in regard to above list) delivered (search for it below).

Update 1.8.2 (15th november 2012)
- NEW: Cannon scene with support of 'new path creation'. When Peach finishes castle level (1-8), you can use the cannon to go to another world. Just press space in its level hole.
- NEW: Peach Castle is now a separate level. If you open the main door, Peach continues the level (outside area). Also, new sideways inside the castle (corridor with toad bedrooms). She will be able to go inside them soon).
- GRAPHIC: Better Peach face/jaw when side faced.
- KEY CHANGE: CTRL instead of ESC to go to Pause Menu. Now you can play this game on irfanview or using executables without exiting the game because of ESC key.
- BUG FIX: "In worldmap, if you press SPACE in a level hole before the black fade circle vanishes, Peach locks up."
- (cosmetic): better path graphics in the Worldmap.
- (executable version). You can find 'MIM AE .RAR' in one of the links above and test it. MIM performance is increased on Dual Core or Single Core CPUs. Windows version only. Beware that save games of SWF version is different from executable version. Both are cache files. Also beware that the executable may be slower in your machine. If so, forget it and keep using the swf.
- (internal): some optimizations to level 1-2 graphics and detection of 'detach/level over level bug' (does not occur so far)

Update 1.8.1 (12th november 2012)
- New Pause Menu (By Soloid)
- New Gameover screen (Art By The Dirty Monkey)
- New outfit: X-naut (By LuftMallow)
- Remake of Peach Dress Powerup (Cute Peach) and Frog Powerup.
- Remake of Level holes in worldmap
- New Mushroom house style (outside) and a new inside area. Peach can go inside it (Level 1-1, try to find it).
- BUG FIXES: yet the glove lingerie problem (black glove locking up in the character screen') and Raccoon Peach 'living tail' bug (without pressing JUMP).
- X-naut level: a little change in the start of the level: Peach requires to be clothed to make TEC-XXX open the door.
- (code): enemies may now stop when the player pauses the game (e.g. pressing ESC, going to her Diary screen or PANIC screen).
- (internal): better code for dialogues and use of _global.PLAYER.isTouchingGround.

Update 1.8 (3rd november 2012)
1- GRAPHICS: NEW PRINCESS PEACH model (actually, her head, hair, eyes, added EARS, a better crown and mouth), and a remake of her Dress and Fire Dress. Made by me using pen tool / illustrator techniques.
2- WARNING: (JUMP) - Players have to PRESS JUMP again for each new jump. Keeping the key pressed all the time will not work.
3- BUG FIX: Treasure chests (Toad House) had powerups that were changing Peach back to vanilla mode, even being fire peach character. Also, fixed the opening animation a bit.
4- BUG FIX: checkpoints in 2-1 and 2-2.
5- BUG FIX: Garter option is now free of 'Black garter lockup', when choosing a color.
6- BUG FIX: x-naut level crashing when Peach takes the end level coin. That's due to 'objects inside objects' limit, in the computers.
7- BUG FIX: Climbing vines, then jumping on other vines are locking Peach up.
8- NEW ANIMATION: Toad jerking, and a new full naked toad in a given area.
9- Cosmetic: more details do TEC-XXX camera, improved coin animation (when it goes out of the block), improved bush and rock graphics (those below Peach castle in 1-1).
10- COSMETIC: little fixes to Sir Grodus (he is now chubbier).
11- Big mushrooms will no more recover clothing parts. More about this here viewtopic.php?f=7&t=2265&p=186398#p186398
12- BUG (COSMETIC) FIX: Pipe perspective on Level1, peach earrings returned to normal size, some blocks are now higher, pink vines in Watery Level (Peach was traversing them), endless coin blocks glitch (happened rarely), vertical-to-horizontal blue squares in watery level, Fire Peach belly button earring color.
MIM AE, instead of having an increase in filesize, it actually decreased due to optimization of these new graphics.

Update 1.7.3 (2nd november 2012)
- Level 2-2 design complete (of course the level could be larger or with more areas to explore. It will be the level Daisy makes her first debut. However, I may create level 2-3 before her appearance on 2-2.
- GRAPHICS: Quicksands in level 2-2 areas (with animation) and 'pond water area' instead of a sub level (Peach will exchange swim mode as soon as she touches water)! I plan creating a 'Peach sinking animation' (for Quicksands)
- GRAPHICS: Better end level poles (green and golden modes)
- GRAPHICS: Improved treasure chest
- COSMETIC fixes to some Peach body clothes and some sex scenes (like goomba).
- A little adjust to Level 1-1 music volume (a bit less).
- Other little fixes, like the POW music (still this problem), that keeps the underground music instead of the main level music, when it wears off.

Update 1.7.2 (30th october 2012)
1- CODE: Peach shoulder clothes/mouth/jaw objects were relocated to inner objects, yielding more precision during animation. Remake of the 'frown' mouth (when she's having sex).
2- CODE: Added 'FPS benchmark', 'internal cumshots' and 'show cum' to save/load mechanism.
3- LEVEL 1 (desert world): more places to go, and moving enemies (pokeys). Stomping not working yet. No sex scenes yet.
4- Improved collision to BREAKABLE blocks. Now, Peach will respect collision until the block is wore off (e.g no coins). Then, the engine will respect SMB2 (Peach traversing blocks). Now its possible to make a full block collision (Peach hitting it all the time), BUT I may not add this because it will increase complexity and will yield more CPU cycles.
5- BUG FIX: POW block mechanism: Peach will no more walk over some coins, and POW music will work better now, when Peach is warping through pipes during its play.
6- BUG FIX: Sometimes, raccon/leaf Peach was not jumping on its fully. (Internal) Also, problems with 'can_grab_touch'. Improved the 'grav' code to deal with it (-5 - negative).
7- Lingerie configuration (garter, stockings, gloves) will retain the last configuration and the player will be able to change it, even if Peach is not using any dress costumes. Of course, changes will be applied on Peach only when she takes a new dress-like powerup.
8- CODE: Poison mushroom speed is a bit slower now.
9- GRAPHICS: Improved Peach body and face (using pen tool). Not much noticeable, but if the player zooms in in some sex scenes, he will see her butt area is better. May need more fixing, as its new. Just for comparison, the old body was 420 curves (360 optimized in brush drawing). After remaking it, 60 curves.
10- FIX: Raccoon Peach (backside mode): the 'vest' was wrongly set up (making the outfit show in front of her butt).
11- Checkpoints: a new option to clean her butt stains/cum.
12- Some other cosmetic and little glitch fixes
Just a notice: I may have 'gained a new level' of Flash skills. I'm now mastering the pen tool as ever, while using the new 'semi balled' technique (I can add shadowing and some 'almost a circle' objects with only 2 curves each, giving still a decent - and low CPU intensive - image). 

Update 1.7.1 (28th october 2012)
1- New: Worldmap of World2 and a playable level (still in progress). You have to defeat Morton in order to get to World2. And You cant go back to World1 (YET)
2- BUG FIX: Flashing lingeries in x-naut level (and sometimes, in other levels too)
3- BUG FIX: Raccoon Peach statue mode
4- BUG FIX: Some TEC-XXX dialogs (more testing needed, though). Fixed a glitch that may lock peach up if she starts the dialogs while jumping.
5- (Only a Warning): For those who love cheating, you can still use 'end level cheat' but all levels wont be opened up anymore. You have to go level by level to open them all. This kills some serious bug later in the game.
6- COSMETIC: some fixes to pipe colors

Update 1.7 (26th october 2012)
1- Added Birdo by Biles (I need to make breathing animation and egg spitting mechanics yet).
1.2- Added Toad by Biles (I still need to add the new Toadette aside of Toadella, and Chancellor)
2- SAVE/LOAD buttons returned. Save/Load mechanism working! BUT it may have bugs yet!
3- New screen: Achievement screen! Luigi is there, helping me to develop that. He's a bit impatient, though.
4- New screen: LOAD game screen with levels that Peach already played before (it will be retained in a local cache file. If you clean the flash cache, it will be erased. I can create a way to show plaintext in the screen, so the player can copy and paste into a txt file upon saving, then he can load this.).
5- New textures: PIPES, flowers (By Asian) and Forest level (2) backgrounds.
6- New itens in gallery (still greyed out): enemies/friends I already have but I need to create animations and scenes.
7- BUG FIX: Bobombs will increase the laid counter (if Peach has sex) and the kill counter will raise when they explode by +1.
8- New friend: Bub-bulbs (in level 2). I will see if I can create a dialog for him so Peach can interact with him.
9- Horny Bar will respond to the bath scene in Peach castle.
10- X-naut levels: better dialogues and a new dialogue in Sir Grodus room.
11- Level 1-2: COSMETIC - Clouds' altitude increased.
12- Level 1-2: Goomba that needs to be fucked/killed is now near the end of the level (but the player still needs to find him).

Update 1.6q (22th october 2012)
A NOTE: just a notice in the PEACH WARDROBE indicating that chosen stockings/garter/heels/gloves will ONLY be enabled in the next powerup with a dress compliant costume (rosalina, daisy, peach and fire peach dresses). This makes sense because she needs to wear new clothing with those new chosen colors/styles.
1- X-naut level: Added 'Peach removing clothes animation' and 'Peach going to the locker' scenes.
Peach removing clothes will be used a lot (e.g. Kamek urging Peach to remove it, Enemies and even some friends blackmailing her, and when she needs to clean herself in that shower checkpoints). My task in x-naut level is almost finished. Before/while creating sex animations for X-naus and Sir Grodus, I want to start making World2 and World Map 2 (its about time).
2- BUG FIX: "When Peach masturbates on a moving platform, she remains stationary and is likely to drop into the abyss". Now, the platform will stop if Peach does any action like masturbating or make sex.
3- BUG FIX: goomba orgy in the gallery area.
4- BUG FIX: problem of black garter not being able to select.
5- BUG FIX: shoulder clothes flashing in Daisy Striker and Hammer Bros outfits.
6- BUG FIX: headless shyguy on his third sex scene.
7- COSMETIC: alterations on Peach FrontSide (in PAUSE MENU) to accept the new earrings, tail and ears. Missing clothes are shown with a message.
8- Increased Leaf size of Leaf Power
9- Update goomba graphics (and goombella foot)
10- Earrings and crown are now separated! This implies: 1) they can be removed (in special situations like x-naut concoctionator room), 2) Invisible Peach will show them correctly.
11- Rearranged/fixed some block positions from level 1 and 3, mostly the green ones.
12- Character Select: now, the player will not be able to set a unicque character for each powerup. Sorry about that, but I decided to let the game more consistent. Its not 'realistic' to have Peach turning to Fire Peach when taking a simple dress, or turning to Rosalina/Daisy when taking frog (remember I will be adding Rosalina/Daisy soon). So, from now on, If the player wants to play with a given character, just select it directly. It will affect all powerups. It's faster to setup it now.

Update 1.6p (16th october 2012)
1- BUG FIX: Running Peach was not grabbing coins correctly.
2- BUG FIX: 'Going to Castle' setTimeout BUG. (internal) Using 'onUnload()' everytime its needed;
3- REVAMP to all mushrooms, blocks and items like 'cloud family' and coins from Biles and 'Coin Block remake' from Biles and Blargh
4- X-naut: New living enemy (x-naut PHD), two large corridors, sir Grodus lounge, 'TEC-XXX', Captive room, Bathroom, CONCOCTIONATOR room and Sir Grodus computer room with living fish chomps (Nibbles) by LuftMallow, with 3 new songs. Remember: this level IS playable. You have to find the grey coin in any of the 7 levels of World1. To left x-naut level, just find the same coin there. In the future, this base will be reached when Peach takes a spaceship, maybe in the end of World2 or World3 (like SMB2).
5- X-naut: Added a quest: TEC-XXX has to communicate with Peach in order to open some doors. Peach can grab the disk and even sit in the Sir Grodus chair and let him angry.
6- X-naut: Added the bath animation (no Peach animation yet). Added a way to interact with the bed and even the toilet (no animation yet).
7- New Peach animation: drinking. It will be used in x-naut level AND in when grabbing potions (like vegetables), in the case peach finds a magic potion to make appear a door. She will drink it in order to cast the spell.
8- X-naut level: Peach can now be invisible (in concoctionator room)! The player can also set this setting in Peach Character screen in any level, like level 1, requiring to set it in a given powerup and then take this powerup (BUT I may disable it soon, because it must be used only with certain potions and levels, not deliberatelly, since enemies will still detect Peach). Also, her shadow will appear if she is invisible BUT THIS SHADOW uses generic mechanics (it will follow Peach vertically too). Working on a better solution.

Update 1.6o (15th october 2012)
1- Bonus pipe area in watery level finally fixed
2- BUG FIX: "When Tanooki Burn Peach is flying, her outer hand flashes back and forth between burn and vanilla skin."
3- BUG FIX:"She can't grab flower powerup in watery level"
4- BUG FIX: (more polished)"She will be descending better on slopes (as well as running)"
5- BUG FIX: Lalala pose, when she's clothed (clothes arent animating)
6- BUG FIX: Fire wheels not detecting Peach
7- BUG FIX: Scrolling problem, when the player chooses RESTART GAME in the Platty or Airship levels.
8- Glitches fix and some improvements to the last koopa scene (pointed out by Asian)
9- BUG FIX: Peach disappearing when she fucks those goombas that fall from the castle (grassland level)
10- Improved graphics like blocks and clouds by Biles (Thanks!!)
11- Created a way to access the roof on level1 (and a new area to explore).
12- Feature: a way to enable/disable auto scroll (it will not be cheating, but a way for the players to enjoy more those levels).
13- Feature: a way to enable/disable PHYSICS: SMB2 or SMB3 (ON/OFF)
14- Goombas, koopas and shyguys will walk with their dicks down (or hidden). If they see Peach, dicks will raise up!
15- (not shown in the game yet)New enemy: Nibbles - its a Chomp fish, side facing with metal teeth. That's not 'cheep cheep'. It will bite Peach butt if she goes in that water.
16- (not in the game yet, but ready to be in the next update) Leaf/Racoon tail attack. Enemies will be thrown out of the screen with the familiar sound.
17- Access to X-naut base corridor, TEC-XX, Sir Grodus lounge and Sir Grodus office! Based on Paper Mario 2. Try to find the gray coin to reach this level, it's not hard to find it (tip: you will have to climb something metalic to reach an area with it!) In the future, X-Naut base will be a world Peach have to explore. Peach will use her invisibility and will have embarrassing moments in the tasks she will need to to. 

Update 1.6n (11th october 2012)
1- NEW: Exclamation Mark feature to enemies that can see Peach. If Peach is seen at a close distance, they will run towards her with more speed until she gets away from their sight. Bloopers (squids) will not be affected, as they have to be fully alive. If Peach is horny, of course they will chase her all the time until she flees or horny bar decreases (and she's out of their view).
2- (internal) New Enemy: Flurry (to be used in icy land)
3- Cosmetic: Leg white highlights were removed (Peach and Fire Peach). There were too many shining areas.
4- BUG FIX: Peach losing her tail in some goomba scenes.
5- Make enemies wait (be stopped) instead of 'running facing the opposite direction' when they are chasing Peach but they are blocked (e.g. by bricks and walls).
6- BUG fix (gallery relock not functioning correctly).
7- Stomping on goombas/toads/shyguys when pressing jump key will let her jump higher
8- Peach can now grab the koopa shell
9- Only one enemy at a time will act on Peach, instead of 'waiting list' in sex scenes -> (code) Advanced MUTEX mechanism
10- (internal) different spawn counter for Left and Right pipes in GrassLand level, lessening effects of 'disappearing goomba right when it comes out'.
11- Mushroom ring will now be lost if Peach is touched for the first time, once she uses Big Mushroom. This mechanic is better and more expected to happen.
12- BUG fix: Peach was not breaking blocks while underwater and while flying. (code) Improved can_grab_touch algorithm, using positive 'grav' to deactivate itself.
13- Glitch fix: Peach may climb down slopes better now (without her descending pose)
14- BUG fix: Raccoon item in level1 was not reappearing when Peach dies (actually, the first powerup block in each level). Also, corrected a small glitch with mushroom ring when breaking some blocks.
15- Watery level: exchanged 'leaf' powerup to 'big mushroom' powerup inside water (to avoid Frog Peach taking Leaf without a purpose)

Update 1.6m (9th october 2012)
1- Big mushroom will now give Peach a Mushroom ring (if she's with a princess dress or naked) giving her extra damage. Clothes will be reconstructed (if shred), no matter which powerup Peach is. Peach (dressed or naked) will only lose this ring when she is stark naked and receives further damage. Only AFTER losing mushroom ring, Peach will use her last resort to be alive: her horny bar. Peach will only CARRY the ring all the time if she's with a normal princess dress or naked. Otherwise, only her clothes are restored.
2- More 'hive' (speakers) boxes in some areas to give hints to Peach
3- Peach will no more slide to left/right if she enters/leaves a door
4- (internal) New enemy: Monty Mole. He will be active with sex scenes sooner or later.
5- BUG FIX - 'going up Peach until the sky if she is backside mode while stomping an enemy'
6- Peach will dance (if she's standing up without movement) if she fucked more than 10 enemies in a level
7- BUG FIX: negative counters in PAUSE SCREEN (laid enemies to be slut of the day and slut of the kingdom)
8- All 8 koopa scenes (with corrections) and also in the gallery
9- Peach new pose: 'surprise'. You can see this pose when Peach talks to herself inside her castle (level 1).
10- Small glitches fixed (like a correct sound for Mushroom grab and better coin sound)
11- Cosmetic: star, mushroom and flower icons in the background of pink messagebox.

Version 1.6l: (7th october 2012)
1- 8th koopa sex scene (By Blargh!). Also, improvements to the other scenes (sounds and animation).
2- 'Slut of the day' in exchange of 'slut of the level'
3- Rewrite of Peach mouth (to be like comics), and creation of other mouths and import of Tifa mouth. THESE MOUTHS are not definitive yet. It may improve more. But the older mouths will be deprecated soon. You can see they're actually quite good in sex scenes.
4- (Not shown in the game yet) New ENEMY: Sir Grodus (for a level I will do -> he will be on the world 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 (tech world))
5- (Not shown in the game yet) New ENEMY: X-NAUTS (to guard the tech area doors).
6- Feature: now, peach will stand up after the scenes instead of appearing 'already stood up'.
7- BUG FIX ATTEMPT #3: Invisible Peach when fucking a lot in hog holes (needs more testing)
8- BUG FIX ATTEMPT #4 for Monty Holes: they must not spawn already dead goombas.
9- Some fixes in Toad Virgin scene and Goomba Slut /Whore scene

Version 1.6k: (5th october 2012 - yes, same day!)
1- Peach Diary! (version 1). Press CONTROL to see it. You can navigate through pages, clicking on them. For now, pages are blank. Maximum of 5 pages. Remember that, in the game start, Peach is dirty, so clean her in order to see the diary cover better. CHEAT keys changed! (for those who dont live without it) - Refer to 'IMPORTANT INFO' area to see which keys were set.
2- (internal) goombella added (you can see her in the title screen)
3- FIX to standing koopa troopa (parts were missing) in the title screen
4- FIX: peach will stay stopped after a sex scene, instead of braking/slippering
5- FIX: second jar exit is now accessible, in The Pond level.
6- FIX: Removed goombas from a given hog hole on the pond level (it must spawn only shyguys)
7- FIX: Sleeping goombas can be fucked again.
8- FIX: Peach should be able to quit a given level that she's playing again
9- FIX to vegetable system

Version 1.6j: (5th october 2012)
1- Configurable MUSIC volume in OPTIONS MENU (I dont plan making SOUND volume because its only a matter of changing operating system / speakers volume. SOUND volume is also more complex to change - more work that can be used to new game features).
2- You can now ENABLE/DISABLE heels' sound in OPTIONS MENU.
3- NEW KOOPA sex scene (total of 7 so far). By Blargh!
4- (internal): different code for doors. Peach MAY NOT lock herself up while jumping and entering a door anymore).
5- changes to animations (backside and frontside) in worldmap, to be synced with heels sound and animations.
6- Fix to raccon, when it gets statue mode while Peach is jumping.
7- Attempt #3 to deal with bobomb explosions freezing up Peach.

Version 1.6h: (3rd october 2012)
1-(internal) big changes in Peach state/type system code (it's not a state machine yet).
2-Collision Algorithm #3 for jumping and for ceilings, like inside of water, green bricks, level 3. Its becoming better. But I will say again: its interesting to have a 100% working code, BUT we dont need to rush to that, as the purpose of this game is to enjoy scenes, puzzles, challenges and new actions. A game that is at least playable with almost no bugs. I've wasted 6 hours only with those code (70% of this time waiting for the computer to compile the code). :/  
Also, Peach will NOT be running in slopes because she will be bouncing a bit. Thats not an error, thats because she falls tenderly in open air, so when descending slopes, she also falls tenderly. If I let Peach fall immediatelly (strong gravity force) she will be able to run in slopes but strange errors will start to appear.
3- new vegetable: carrot
4- fixes to vegetable system
5- new: heels sound
6- new functionality: timer is now inverse (chronometer). If Peach gets late (say, 400 seconds in game's time, can be more), Peach may receive a penalty (like sex) -> in the future.
7- Current stats 'embarrassed/did nasty things/a whore' (in the level) and 'virgin/indecent/screwed/a total slut' (in pause menu), with the remaining creatures count.
8- Fix to OPTIONS MENU background (hidden glitch, only appears when the game is in full screen mode in HD monitors)
9- Improved Peach falling pose (it should be tender, even if falling long distances, not frightening) - by Biles
10- Get rid of slippering sound in scrolling levels. SMB3 doesnt cast this sound.
11- Improvement: donuts will reappear if Peach loses a life
12- jumping shyguys are stompable now. 
13- New animations for 'falling' Peach (needed because of 1), and going into doors/pipes while carrying a vegetable. (If Peach enter/exits an upside-down pipe, she will drop it).
14- Peach will accelerate/deaccelerate with smoke effects and sound. I've played SMB2 and 3 (as I own Super Mario All Stars) and the physics are now almost equal. The game MAY be a bit harder to jump on platforms, but acceleration is, in fact, a very interesting function that adds realism and let me create more walking animation, like when she lifts her dress.
15- Fix: Peach right breast when she's leaving a pipe.
16- Fix: Poison Mushroom with a more evil face

Version 1.6d (28th september 2012)
1) New graphics: zigzag mushroom mountains. You can see it in the Platty Level.
2) NEW: Peach grabbing vegetable, walking and jumping with it. No scenes yet, and it does not knock out enemies yet. It may have bugs.
3) Bug Fix (attempt #2) in Level 4 (end of the level - castle area): Peach may not disappear anymore when having sex with goombas
4) Peach will now use pipes facing frontside.
5) Fix to the pipe area on level2 freezing Peach if the player keeps pressing down.
6) Fix to the cloud platforms in level2
7) Removed '1up' glitch in level stats
8) Now, each level will have a predominant enemy race. e.g. Level 1 -> only goombas. Level 2 -> only goombas. Hog holes will also spawn only the predominant race.

Version 1.6b (26th september 2012)
1) Improved Mushroom houses with the help of Soda and Biles.
2) New graphics: red fruit and vegetable leaves (in red) in some levels! But I need to do more code to them, animation of Peach taking the veggy, and scenes of Peach using them for...interesting things. Anyway, they're active and Peach can grab them (for fruits, just pass over them. For veggies, press RUN key while on them, like Mario2).
3) New graphics: improved level warp zones in World Map.
4) New graphics: improved mushroom platform (by me).
5) New: Monty hole! You can see it in the end of level2. BEWARE, dont walk over it, or Peach will fall. But if you're curious... This is a place that enemies fall underground, so they try to get out using hog holes all over the level. There will be more of these holes. For about hog holes, I plan adding Monty Mole (enemy) to throw enemies from it.
6) New: Sneaker goombas inside some brown mario castles (those in the end of the level). Beware of them.
7) Little fix for do-over functionality in goombas.
8) Little fix to Daisy Dress: her dress doesn't accept custom gloves!
9) Little fix to leaf icon in HUD.
10) Fix to Osama castle: Peach no more falls offground when going left.
11) Fix to scrolling camera, which doesnt stop when textbox (pink square) appears in.
12) Removed the possibility of Peach taking Poison mushroom in the Toad House.

Version 1.6a (24th september 2012)
1) I decided that 'Big Mushrooms' will no more give Peach a Mario outfit, but Peach requires to be Dressed in order to take Fire Power from blocks. Mario is a special outfit Peach may encounter in some levels. It will have some abilities. Mushroom will let her recover the current clothes instead, in case they're shred (this was deprecated in later versions). If she's naked, she will remain naked but with an extra hit. In both cases, the mushroom will increase boob sizes. In the future, Perry (her umbrella) will be added to her in order to let player know Peach has an extra hit and an attack / fuck scene mode. <- But I prefer this to be a new powerup item, not a Mushroom.
2) Attempt #2 to fix 'flash monster' bug (LALEM - Level After Level Mangling). Requires testing.
3) New graphics: Poison Mushroom.
4) Some fixes to Ending Virgin scene (Toads).  Also, toads are now bottomless.
5) Gallery: Access to Bloopers (Squids), added new buttons (for future enemies), some cosmetic changes.
6) Powerup: Poison icon will no more appear in the HUD because Peach is already naked. If peach dies, 'Poison' will no more appear as well.
7) Yet more fixes to running code. peach should fly ok now.

Version 1.6 (22th september 2012 - yes, 1 day after!)
1) Entire NEW block mechanism: e.g. Peach will only get Flower power or leaf if she is a Mario Peach, Racer Peach, Frog Peach, Leaf, Raccoon Peach or Fire Peach herself. Otherwise, it will grow a mushroom there. Peach will be a Super Peach (with Mario clothes) upon taking this mushroom. Added more variety to invisible blocks (there will be invisible mushrooms and poisons too, not only lives).
2) Entire code change in the Gallery, fixing bugs like 'YOU WIN' window when pressing 'back' button in SMB1 ending there. Added new buttons (like REPLAY), added 2 koopa scenes that were missing, and horny bar will not increase anymore.
3) GALLERY (Bug Fix): now its possible to change Peach character and costumes there without glitches.
4) GALLERY: Clouds (to indicate Peach is dreaming about herself doing the scenes) and 4 changeable backgrounds for the user.
5) NEW golden blocks that give mushrooms, lives, flower power and poison.
6) NEW: you can exit a level Peach has finished before, just in case you got stuck, replayed a level by mistake, or just encountered what you wanted (e.g. a life or a bonus item).
7) Fire Peach fireballs finally done (only the physics)! Press attack key (Z or H for example, depending on your Keyboard config chosen in the game). In the future, fireballs will let enemies stunned for some seconds, letting them angry, or fireballs can pop them.
8) Peach will now be able to retain clothes while taking LEAF powerup -> e.g. Peach Dress, Rosalina, Daisy, Mario and Sling costumes, so her clothing can be shred as usual. If she's a Raccoon, Hammer Bros, Fire or Frog (special costumes!), she will be a naked lady with tail and ears. 
9)New algorithm for running Peach (Code #2): Peach MAY NOT be locked up anymore when taking Frog , then Leaf Power, and other smaller glitches. Test needed.
10) Rearrangement of camera placement in the layer. I dont know why, some of enemies started to behave with 'spring effect' only in Level1, because of 'first camera activation', while its placed in a layer above the enemies layer.
11) New bug fix in the PlatformLand level in order to avoid Peach disappearing when having sex with goombas
12) New bug fix in Platty level. Now, if you go to the PAUSE MENU or Peach is in a scene, the scrolling will stop. Then, it will resume.
13) Airship level now scrolls!
14) World Map: Added Peach castle.

Version 1.5l (21th september 2012)
1) New outfit: HammerBros. It won't be just an outfit. I plan Peach to throw HAMMERS in the future. These will harm enemies but will let them angrier and angrier, according to the number of hits. I plan making sex scenes that, If Peach is a HammerPeach, the enemy will use the hammer into her!
2) New: Mario outfit now has a hat!
3) New: Better blushing algorithm with a bit AI!
4) Fix: better yellow color in Peach hair color and changes to all graphics of her hair (maintaining consistency!) 
5) Fix: Platty level: the scroll now works even if Peach dies or replay the level. Also, added collisions to avoid Peach going in unexpected places in the end of the level.
6) Fix: Coinboxes now functions correctly
7) Fix: 'Goomba respawn' pipes in level 4 MAY not let Peach disappear again
8) Cosmetic: Border to 'all costumes' and 'all characters' buttons in Character Select Screen
9) Fix: now, the HUD will only show the laid/kill numbers of the actual level. PAUSE MENU will show the TOTAL amount.
10) Fix: Peach no more loses her lingerie if the player goes to PAUSE MENU right in the beginning of the game.
11) Fix: Daisy Striker outfit -> back clothing and bra should be appearing correctly now.
12) Fix: Toads in the lounge area no more have the 'text' bug all over the place, throwing the dialog of Level2.

Version 1.5k: (19th september 2012)
1) NEW level: Platty (by me) with auto scrolling! Its not complete yet but its playable and has an exit.
2) NEW costume: Daisy Striker outfit by Biles
3) New items in the World Map, like white castle and a moving airship. Removed the star blinking from the level circles.
4) Little animation while in backside mode. Also, player doesnt need to keep pressing UP to see her backside.
5) Fix to Koopa Troopa (back to version 1 , but improved)
6) Fix to the 'recycle' bug (tests needed): Peach now can have sex with tons of enemies respawning from Hog Holes, one at a time, without her disappearing.
7) Fix to the Peach pubes color when a Fire Peach walks frontside (like in the World Map).
8) Improved Peach backside and frontside gait, as well as Peach arms when frontside.
9) Character Select Screen: no more possible to add clothing to RACCOON powerup. Why? Because Raccoon is a SPECIAL powerup that let Peach fly. The costume should not change because Peach may appear without a tail! However, you can still change DRESS, FIRE, RACER MUSHROOM and FROG costumes, but remember that these new clothes will change only when Peach gets that powerup, not immediatelly upon changing in the character screen!
10) Changed text from 'Racer Speedy Peach' to just 'Speedy Peach' when taking up Racer Mushroom (thats because Peach may be using another costume).
11) Toad eyes will blink. Osama mouth/beard will move when talking.
12) Changed the way the toad talks to Peach in Level 2: a button will appear if Peach gets near him. This will be the default behavior for encounters.
13) FIXED bug in Level 2. When Peach dies with the key, she was't able to get the goomba again when talking with the toad.

Version 1.5h (17th september 2012)
1) Better collision and gravity code (Algorithm #3) with ApplyMovement (Peach will not jig anymore and she will go down slopes without 'little jumps'). Game may be up to 3 FPS faster.
2) Improved World Map level with new assets
3) Improved fade out in each level (you will see no more the background map in a stance)
4) Peach will ricochet upwards if she stomps enemies

Version 1.5g (13th september 2012)
1) NEW: World Map with effects! Now you can even repeat the same level if you want! To access it, you have to finish the first level, because Peach starts the game inside her castle.
2) NEW: Peach Frontside by LuftMallow (Breasts may be not ideal. I will fix during the next updates). You can see her in the World Map and in tanooki suit, statue mode.
3) NEW: 'Shower Checkpoint'! Art by me. But not working yet. Its just a normal checkpoint. Soon Peach will take a bath there to remove her...juices. Its in Level 1.
4) NEW: FPS Benchmark mode. Go to the OPTIONS MENU.
5) New Mario sounds (SMB1, 2 and 3 endings) and better Pause sound. Also, the background music will be quieter during Pause
 
Version 1.5e (9th september 2012)
1) Zoom settings are now saved for the next level.
2) Fixed zoom-in camera movement (it has been stopping before getting the left and right edges of the level, so Peach might walk off screen).
3) Remade Koopa expression (no more 'dumb' expression). Now three eye expressions: opened, lidded and closed.
4) Stop timer while going into vases
5) Key icon in the HUD, and a message informing Peach has gotten a key.
6) Fixed the stomped goomba-spree all over the game, once and for all (NEEDs testing!)

Version 1.5d (8th september 2012)
1) Fixes to boob sizes between levels (Peach has been starting the new level with default speed, even with biggest boobs). Also, boob size will also affect jump height. New boob bouncing sound added when Peach is with max boob size.
2) Fixed a corruption with DO-OVER key (V) - it was creating shyguys!
3) NEW graphic: mushroom mountain (cilinder one, full of circles) 100% done using pen tool (127 curves instead of 899).
4) Improved smoke graphics for Tanooki Suit, statue mode.
5) Better Peach portrait graphics. Added more detail, like neck.
6) Fix to ceiling collision in castle level.
7) NEW: Toad House area as a BONUS LEVEL. If Peach takes a special coin (there are three of them in all the 7 levels, search for them!), Peach will be able to go to a special level in the end of the current level. She will enter in one mushroom house in a nighty forest area then she can open one of three treasure chests. The bonus will act immediatelly. SOON, a Toad will be there and it will walk towards peach upon opening the chest (He will ask for a gift. Peach can refuse). AND powerup INVENTORY system (in the future, when I have world MAP!)

Version 1.5b (6th september 2012)
1) New peach sound: 'no' (when she refuses to do actions while meeting creatures).
2) Shyguy new sex scene (3rd)
3) New intro area, portraits and animations: Kamek cursing Peach portraits
4) Changed Peach mouth during standing up pose animation
5) Massive changes to Peach eyes mechanism. I'm tired of the actual way her eyes function (they're separate items). Not anymore.  Eyes will be part of her head, so no more eyes moving awkward in some scenes, like they're floating. More consistency and support for look left/right and other actions.
6) Fix to the Heels select. For unknown reasons, Black heels disappeared.
7) Fix to the 'Burn' icon in the HUD and pause screen. It was showing the Poison instead.
8) Cum dripping in Peach, when horny bar is more than 50% (experimental)

Version 1.5 (3rd september 2012 - yes, same day!)
1) New: ground, fence and sand textures.
2) New: Improved Koopa using Playshapes model
3) New: Kamek enemy (not shown in the game yet)
4) New level: Grassland (after Watery level)
5) New feature: goombas sprouting from pipes (in Grassland level).
6) New feature: invisible blocks!
7) Little fix to chancellor balloon. If Peach is not naked in the beginning of the game, she will not say 'I am naked' anymore.
8) Improved Luigi (WEEGEE!!) from Playshapes (you can see him in the Mario Bros endings)

Version 1.4v (3rd september 2012)
1) Fixed Falling goombas in some levels and end levels from which they shouldn't appear (may need more testing).
2) New powerup in character select: Leaf. You can choose a character for it now (but not a costume, as leaf mechanics are different - e.g. Peach will be naked with a tail if she is using fire or frog)
3) Yet some more optimization to gravity (she will be trembling/jigging even less)

Version 1.4t (31th august 2012)
1) FIXED a very BAD bug in the panic button area. When you leave it, Peach started changing costumes like crazy.
2) Sound Button in the loading screen (so you can disable music/sound right away, as desired)
3) Deep Fix to the three SMB endings (Current Peach character and costume will be shown). You can't change costumes in that area because you need to struggle to get to Morton using the costume you want to appear there.
4) New graphic: mushroom plateau (you can see it in the level 'The Pond')
5) Mario now blinks and looks left/right in the endings. It can be used when he's walking (in the future). I plan using this same technique to enemies and Peach friends.
6) Better gravity algorithm (Peach will bounce/jig up and down far less than before)
7) Better and optimized camera scroll (saved a bit of game FPS)
8) Little fix to the button 'apply chosen skin'.

Version 1.4q (28th august 2012)
1) No more activation of stockings/garter/shoes/gloves in character select, in the case Peach is stark naked for example. (You can select the desired stockings/gather/shoes/gloves before starting the game). And no more immediate changing of costumes (this is cheating!). Changing skin is possible anytime (just click in the button 'APPLY CHOSEN SKIN'). So, if Peach is almost naked (only with shoes on and part of the dress bra), going to character select will let you change the color of the shoes and the costume that will appear when touching the given powerups along the level!
I do this because, in the actual way, player could put new shoes, garter, etc, like magic. This is considered a cheat. Peach should only get these clothing parts when putting on a dress.  
2) Also in character select, no more way to change POISON mushroom to a cloth item, as its role is to let Peach naked.
3) Reorganization of intro screen
4) Three new songs from Mario2 and Mario World. Two of them was remastered with high quality instruments from scratch.
5) A fix to Racer mushroom bug
6) Added a checkpoint flag in level 4 (The Pond).
7) Support for pulsating stars (not shown in the game yet)!
8) Corrections to some assets, like red Mushroom houses, closet and inclusion of shadows in Peach bedroom.
9) NEW: Mario outfit for Peach
10) The heaviest boob size will let her bra shred, and her speed almost crawling. Player will have to let her lactate to regain speed.
11) A bug fix to the talking toad in the end of second level. If Peach refuses, now the correct breast size and speed will be cast!

Version 1.4p (27th august 2012)
1) New enemy: Boo! He will close his eyes if Peach faces him, otherwise he will wander towards her. No sex scenes yet.
2) Ghost house door (it will be placed in the Morton's Castle). Now, Peach will have to go into them to reach Morton.
3) New feature: different background colors in each level, resembling dawn, scary and night levels.
4) Heavy bug fix in level boundary area. Some corrections needed too (sometimes Peach can go beyond some level boundaries)
5) Bug Fix: Boob Size will be applied correctly on clothes, in the character select screen
6) Bug fix: when Peach loses a skirt, it was still appearing on her, but not when she's facing backside. It should disappear now in every pose.
7) Bug fix: while in pause menu in some areas with hazards (like the fire whell), the hazard item was appearing in this screen.
8) Bug fix: Butt while using Rosalina dress.
9) Bug fix: no more falling enemies in inter level screen (MAYBE) - needs testing
10) Easter Egg in credits screen (you can click on some areas to hear some sounds).
11) Added 'hump' sound in the 6th koopa scene (threesome).
12) Added score points when fucking enemies. The more advanced scenes Peach is in, more points she earns. Peach earns points if she stomps them too.
13) Improved the 'squatting sex koopa scene' (5th). Please tell me any possible problems with this scene, as it's new.

Version 1.4i (25th august 2012)
1) Better camera mechanism: in each level, no more camera trying to find Peach (before, you could see the sky and other places until finding her).
2) Now, timer will stop during interactive text messages.
3) NEW SOUND: message box.
4) Cosmetic: Fixed Peach thigh, ponytail redone from scratch using PEN/BEZIER curves. 
5) New friend: Osama (he will appear in the game but not as a fuckable human. I plan making him talk to Peach in some areas, like Japanese Mario Bros2 as the picture!) Soon, it will be fuckable in his castle lounge before Airship levels (Peach can flee too).
6) New small level - Osama castle (before Airship) with new music and some caveats.
7) Little fix to Peach toes
8) Fix to key Puzzle in level 2 (when you stomped the goomba, he hasn't been giving you the key).
9) Birdo new body: Chibi.
10) Added Daisy and Rosalina OUTFIT, by Luftmallow. But Peach image in the Pause Menu wont have those clothes because an artist is needed to do that.
11) New koopa sex scene by Blargh!  With added feet movement (By yuri) and asshole (By Blargh). It will be placed in the 5th scene. The 6th scene is the threesome.
12) Moving clouds in Airship level.
13) Some fixes to Striker forearm
14) Fixes to the Burn Mushroom powerup
15) Fixes to golden blocks (they're acting like invisible blocks after coins was grabbed)
16) Fixes to lounge area (invisible ground floor)
17) Added more enemies in the Gallery mode, and some improvements there.
18) Revamped character select screen, with 3 Peach animations (just click on her!) 
19) Yet another bug fix regarding P power playing forever if Peach loses a life.

Version 1.4f (22th august 2012)
1) Hog holes functionality (enemies will only respawn in those areas, when Peach is near them and horny)
2) New shoes by yurinicolau
3) Some changes to masturbation scene (feet).
4) New koopa tropa: RED color.
5) More space in level 2 (watery).
6) New enemy: Birdo! She will be walking in some areas (level 2 and level 4). No sex scenes and no egg physics yet (it will disappear as soon as it goes out).
7) New vines with leaves to be climbed to (by Slayer_J)
8) More blushing varieties and a fix to its color.
9) Fixes to Peach body and neck/breast shadows/blush
10) Bug fix - Peach should no more freeze if the gamer keeps JUMP key pressed while Peach is cumming until the end.

Version 1.4e (17th august 2012)
1) Koopa can be stomped (all mechanics implemented: he goes into the shell. After some seconds, the koopa reappears from the shell. If Peach stomps again while in the shell, it will run along the level. BUT! The shell doesn't kick out other enemies - because this will let Peach avoid sex scenes more when a koopa is nearby).
2) Improved end level stats background with new music
3) Fix to the vase area (the P-switch music will no more reset music to underground one, even Peach being outside the vase).
4) Peach will now be able to stomp enemies even naked (due to the fact the player may let Peach lose a life in a place without powerups but with tons of enemies, and he doesnt want Peach to fuck there, so he can try to stomp on them).
5) Yet better pipe mechanism (now Peach can go above the pipe in watery level without being sucked by it, for example).

Version 1.4 to 1.4d (16th august 2012)
1) Fixed bugs in bath area (Peach will no more take a bath while fucking)
2) Fix bugs avoiding Peach to climb the slope in The Pond level correctly.
3) Game over with black background and Inter-Level screen with black blackground and a picture of the level (to resemble classic Mario)
4) Some tweaks to the code (a bit more FPS)
5) STILL TESTING: Improved speed in lounge area of level 1
6) Peach won't be floating in the air / going to the upper platform if she touches an enemy while jumping.
7) NEW: Cannons working in Airship level. You can kick them too (jumping on them).
8) NEW: some dialogs and better Chancellor texts in level 1.
9) FIXED bug in checkpoints (Peach no more can activate it while in the lower platform in level 1)
10) Cheat mechanism still Control+0, after this, PAGE DOWN = 'go to the next level', PAGE UP = 'almost cumming mode'. Remember, using cheats will reset your score points in each level!
11) NEW: backside mode improved (thanks Luftmallow!)
12) NEW: Better music for Mushroom Kingdom! Remastered with VST by me.
13) Goombas no more slide down slopes while in sex scenes
14) No more tons of shyguys leaving the vase. And it will stop popping out if Peach is in action.
15) Restart level mechanism will not restart 'laid, orgasm and stomped' numbers anymore.
16) Text balloons with improved words (thanks DoggieDog52!)
17) Text balloons should be in right direction for 10th goomba scene and shyguy scenes
18) NEW level being developed: Airship by DigFree. It will be placed after 'The Pond' and it will have the inside level (Boss area), but  without a boss at this time.  80% complete.
19) Pipe color support (green, red, grey and yellow)
20) Fix to the four bobomb sex scene (I still don't understand why this became corrupted somehow)
21) FIX: jumping shyguy should hit Peach only if she really touches him (like jumping over him or trying to pass through him).
22) Improved climbing algorithm.

Version 1.3d (11th august 2012)
1) NEW: FOOT left/right by yurinicolau!
2) NEW: Nail colors
3) NEW: PIRANHA PLANT by Slayer_J!
4) NEW: two Shyguy sex scenes (dont work with jumping ones yet)
5) NEW: Shyguys can be stomped (except the jumping one), but remember, as the goombas, Peach needs to be full clothed (dress, fire, striker or tanooki suit)
6) more variety in balloon texts for goomba, koopa, shyguys and bloopers during scenes
7) Better mechanism for running bobombs
8) Improved jumping animation (Peach arms)
9) NEW: Improved fade_in/out between pipe/vase transportation
10) NEW: Golden Key for the Puzzle area in level 2 (a surprise). Better way to distinguish the right goomba to get the key. Also, stomping on him SHOULD give you the key as well.
11) NEW: Tail image in tanooki/leaf Peach when Backside mode (it animates when entering doors/vases)
12) NEW: stompable cheep cheeps (those flying)
13) NEW: Total Restart Level mechanism (when Peach dies for example).
14) (internal): changed relay system (due to a new 'restart level' mechanism).
15) FIX: some text balloon problems
16) FIX: climbing up/down with wrong gravity (it was heavy)
17) More tender falling animation when Peach goes inside a vertical pipe.
18) More tender edge color of white stocking

Version 1.3 (4th august 2013)
1) NEW: raccoon statue mode (PRESS Z - action/fireballs key, or H - lefthand). In this state, Peach avoids enemies harming (and fucking) her.

7) Some improved graphics to the vase area (level 4)
8) A new sound for the pause menu
9) FIX: Striker outfit in Burn Mushroom Power will accept burn peach character as well.
10) A bit different but better animation of the 'leaving vase' animation.
11) FIX: thwomp no more hits peach when she's in a sex scene.
12) Feature: Now, when Peach takes tanooki suit while being fire peach, she will be 'burn raccoon'. This also applies for the other powerups. Of course, this will not work if you obligue Peach to be burnt when taking a given powerup. Even being normal Peach, she will be burnt because of this.

Version 1.28 (1nd august 2012)
1) NEW: shyguys leaving vases (level 4)
2) NEW: Living Big Mushroom (Bigshroom). Search for them in the brick blocks.
3) NEW:  Enemies going to Rape Peach. if peach is near to cum, random enemies will appear next to her. There is a limit of them, otherwise the game would be so slow and might even crash! Anyway, enemies will wander to get her at any cost (I'll let the fantasy for the player to create!)

Version 1.26f (26th july 2012)
1) better dicks for all enemies and Morton in particular
2) NEW grass ground texture. Sorry if it appears a bit flat. It was needed, because it was traced before (from a heavy bmp I did). The good side using native vectors is that the game is a lot faster in the levels they're used.
3) NEW level: The Pond. Its still incomplete, please wait for its completion. You can reach the castle, though.
4) improved Peach foot (thanks to Slayer_J!)
5) REWRITE of the randomizer code to allow Peach fuck a random scene after laying out all goombas/koopas scenes (11 for goombas, 4 for koopas so far).
6) improved 'DEL' key. If Peach is stuck, you can use DEL and she should now appear without being locked up or ghost mode.
7) NEW: Shyguy, goomba and koopas with living code!! A so-awaited achievement. Shyguys wander, but no sex scenes yet! He has a dick but isnt shown because its retractable. He will let it out when Peach touches him in the future.
8) Fixed problem disappearing garter/stockings/bra/vest/heels/gloves when the player changes default powerups with new costumes.
9) Fixed vision collision in the new goombas

2) Fixes to horny bar not resetting in some goomba scenes
3) Fixed some internal cumshots of the goombas
4) NEW: goomba scene (its the 8th goomba sex scene). The gangbang changed to the 11th scene instead of 10th. 
5) Added randomness after the last sex scene. E.g. If peach fucks the 11th goomba, she should fuck the following goombas with a random style. Remember that you can access the 11th scene even if a given level has only 5 goombas. You only need to let peach fuck 6 more goombas in the next levels. 

Version 1.26c (22th july 2012)
1) Fixed 16 little bugs, most of them regarding cloth parts. Thanks for those who helped me address that!
2) Added shredding sound for Peach clothes
3) HUD messages when Peach is hurt or when she is stark naked
4) Added 'thwomp!' sound to the P switch.
5) NEW SEX SCENE (goomba 11th): Try to find it. No, its not required to fuck 10 goombas first! Some will love it, some don't. Anyway, Peach animations are really smooth.
6) Added 'zzz' images for sleeping goombas
7) The new sex scene was improved (animations), with new sounds and an internal cumshot, and now Peach can replay it using DO-OVER key.
8) Added 'i' key for internal cumshots. When you press it, it will show activation in the message area.
9) Increased cumshot image in the 9th goomba scene (it was smaller).
10) Bloopers scenes interrupt the timer now, and its compatible with bikini shredding
11) (internal) changed save/load game in order to avoid messing up with other MIM version, like Blargh version. SAVE/LOAD still disabled.
12) Endings with 'SKIP' button and 'BACK' button.

Version 1.26 (20th july 2012)
1) NEW: 2 heels, 2 stockings, 3 garter belts and 2 gloves types for Peach (you can change it in character select screen, bottom right corner buttons). The heels only work for normal Peach, as Fire Peach uses the special white heels already (its a powerup requirement!) The stockings, garters and gloves work with Peach and FirePeach (naked or clothed). Not in Raccoon, sling or striker for obvious reasons. Also, you can let her barefoot (only in Peach/Naked Peach because, again, Fire Peach is a special powerup which requires the white heels).
2) NEW: you now can go inside dweelings. The first dweeling is accessible (level 1). Just press UP there. Thanks DigFree!
3) Some fixes to 'single left hand' keys.
4) Revamped mushroom houses and goombas. Art by Soda.
5) Fixed 'same music underwater' problem, when Peach dies inside water and reappear in the beginning of the level with the same underwater music.
6) Fixed glitch in the first door of the castle, second level, which let Peach go in the castle in the beginning of the level instead of next level
7) The fourth koopa in the castle level may be used now.
8) Removed 'exit credits' button (the pink one) in credits screen right in the first menu of the game, as there is another button (blue one) already. 
9) NEW: Detachable clothing. Peach will lose a cloth part if either she is hit or she does a sex scene (for now, goombas and koopas so far). If Peach loses all and then a non-fuckable enemy hits her, she would die if she doesnt have enough horny level.

Version 1.25g (17th july 2012)
1) Ceiling collision in the skies of all levels.
2) Fixed rare bug: when Peach is entering a pipe or during a scene, if the player presses ESC (pausing the game) then goes back, he can control an invisible Peach.
3) Fixed glitch that let Peach a bit far from the wall in some cliffs (like level 1)
4) Panic mode added. Press ENTER while in the game! Press ESC to go back. Be aware it will turn off music too. Just press 'M' or go to HELP MENU then OPTIONS to activate it again.
5) Cosmetic: removed Load/Save game icons (its not implemented yet).
6) When time is up, Peach no more loses a life, but she loses a few points. Soon I'll be implementing a special fucking scene for that.
7) Better rocky background in level2 (based on Mario2) with faster FPS.
8) Peach can only break one brick at a time, to get coins or to destroy the brick.
9) Goomba/koopa dick head with a more expected color (reddish).
10)Fixed peach backside (mooning mode) letting her floating in the air when the donut blocks fall (red ones)
11)'Collision-non collision-collision' sensitivity improved for running states (it will only cancel running if Peach runs a bit without a ground). A very good example of this is in slopes. Peach may have problems to run while descending stairs (understandable), as it make her gait awkward to fly. But she can run freely in ascending slopes.
12) Fixed a bug that let Peach locked up when cumming during lactation.
13) Fixed yet some bug in doors

Version 1.25: (15th july 2012)
1) Fixed the problem with running key not functioning sometimes (requiring to release run button AND left and right). Peach may run okay now.
However, level one still has little places to run. I'll be adding more places soon.
2) Fixed 'peach quickly lurking left' glitch while swimming the water, when pressing left, then right.
3) Fixed Frog Peach going through walls if she walks while in the water ground
4) Puzzles/Trivia added! In level 2. See if you can solve it! Also added locked door sound effect.
5) Added drifting when normal Peach stays floating in the water without swimming. Also, animations has a faster response if the player wanders along the water.
6) Small cosmetic changes to level 1
7) Added more koopas in level 3 and 4, and more bobombs in level 2, in order to enjoy more sex scenes. 
8) Timer now punishes Peach if its zero. Peach loses a life, becomes naked, and goes to the last checkpoint, then the timer goes back to 400. You don't lose any score point/coin/laid enemies.
9) NEW: Four new keyboard layouts. Choose one in the beginning of the game. For now, no way to change this config in options. You can restart the game early (like in level1) if you want another config, anyway. 
10) Keyboard layout screen: you can press the number (1 to 4) to choose it, aside of clicking with the mouse.
11) Revival to the toads color
12) Better balloons code for the toads
13) Revival to Peach's Clothes
14) Underground bonus area in Level 2 (try to find it, not hard)

19) included ceilling collision for flying raccoon.
20) fixed glitch which let Peach not bend when cumming.

Version 1.24: (12th july 2012)
1) Some fixes to clipping and running bar (in order to let Peach fly), because it was being locked in some situations, like when she took new powerups.
2) Fixed small glitch in the castle of level 2.
3) Running key added! (X or .) You will need to keep it pressed in order to let Peach run and let the 5 triangles grow red. Don't work in Frog mode or underwater.
 3.1) Fixed a bug when running towards a wall. Peach might trespass the wall and go into the void.
4) Fixed strange bug in Morton Castle: Thwomp (rock enemy) was with old code.
5) Added invisible coins functionality to P (POW) Switch in level 2. Try to get them all on time!
6) Fixed old glitch which let Peach walk and masturbate (in case of pressing RIGHT/LEFT/D/A while pressing DOWN or S)

8) (internal) some code optimization dealing with timers.

Version 1.2 (BEWARE, Jump key is now 'C' and 'K'! Explained below!) - (11th july 2012)
1) New Level: 'The Forest' (in progress - 80%). Its placed in level 2. 'Watery' was moved to level 3.
2) New animation: RUNNING. If you walk for some time (without descending strong slopes or without jumping) she will run (Animation By Biles).
3) JUMP KEY IS NOW 'C' and 'K', for WASD. SORRY but I reached a limit of choice because of browsers not allowing us to disable their shortcuts!! Its easy to relearn this key. This method will also let us use Z and X better. Please observe that left handed people and people who prefer WASD play this game. That's the ONLY way to circunvent that and let the layout friendly to other platforms, as MAC. You will also be able to change which keyboard layout you will use in the later versions, anyway.
4) Improvement to peach when breaking blocks while jumping
5) Now, old toad will give points to Peach after the first scene.
6) Fixed a glitch which let Peach with Tanooki Suit unable to swim.
7) New item: "P POWER". Its in the new second level. No invisible coins and doors to discover yet.
8) Two new songs (created/edited/resampled) resembling Mario3. You will see them playing along the game.
9) New object: Red Balled platforms which rotates around their cores.
10) Fixed a glitch with a stopped BoBomb which explodes if Peach touches it (its NOT the fucked bobomb that needs to press END key. Its another bobomb). the problem: Peach was unable to move after the explosion.

Version 1.16 (7th july 2012)
1) New Level: 'The Forest' (in progress)
2) Fixed a bug in the first pipe of the watery level. Not related to the new code.
3) Added cheat mode (Control+0 to turn it on, then HOME to go to the next level). This is for testing only! No bonuses, and the score will be zero in each level!

Version 1.15 to 1.15b (6th july 2012)
1) New pipe code (from scratch). Peach no more has to jump (sometimes three to five times) to get into one.
2) Fixed fire power in level 2
3) Tingling sound when 'p' power becomes 100%, just before Peach can fly
4) New swimming animation by Biles with a better control, more close to original Mario Bros series
- Control - JUMP - will make her swim up.
- If she is using frog power, UP and DOWN keys is used to maneuver in the water.
5) New collision system in underwater area (but still not perfect). 
6) Eating too many mushrooms will also increase horny bar.
7) Small change to Bob-Ombs, so he will explode only if Peach touches them, when they're exausted.
8) Small change to her jumping animation (tiny cosmetic change)
9) Added custom sex scene indicator in status message (press 0-9 in a laid enemy to see it).
10) Some small fixes in pipe locations and walls in level 2
11) Full pipe animation implemented (that is, Peach goes in and out with animation and some sounds). This required total revamp of pipe code.

Version 1.13g
1) The game became easier. If Peach is hit by hazards (like fire wheels) or bad enemies like thwomps, while naked, horny bar decreases instead of dying. If horny bar is next to 0, or 0, peach loses a life. So, keep the horny bar higher! ;)
2) Chomp-chomp is in the game (in watery level). Be careful of him!
3) Status message area added (indicates activation of Locking Costumes, Music, and so on)
4) Fade-in and Fade-out effects if Peach loses a life or goes long distances using pipes
5) Peach flying mode implemented (with Raccoon suit). Also with speed bar. You need to take Raccoon suit to get the speed bar.
No running modes yet. Just walk in the same direction and while touching the floor.
6) New peach sounds when she is hit or loses a life.
7) New HUD item: Killed enemies. Now, Laid (sex scene) number is pink. Rules changed. If a given level has, say, 5 goombas, and you fuck them all, Peach will be a whore of the level (instead of the fixed 10 enemies). 'Virgin' is changed to 'Embarrassed for sex'. In the future, player can still try to let Peach Virgin in the whole game. Remember that only goombas can be killed yet.
8) Some fixes to the coins.
9) Added 'orgasms' number to be counted (it shows in level stats). Better level stats numbers.

Version 1.13c:
1) Frog animation outside water or if she's touching the ground underwater (Peach will be squatting).
2) Fix to Peach's arm while stopped in the ground, with Frog power.
3) Better Peach Jumping animation (like Mario), with 'punching hands up'.
4) Ceiling collisions in missed areas in Watery Level (level2)

7) Tip system added.
8) You can earn some points cleaning her juices (like in the bath or checkpoints) or cumming while in masturbation scene.

Version 1.12 (some fixes):
1) peach lactates a bit (some milk goes out) while in lactate mode, and she can milk even more if breasts are bigger.
2) fixed frog and racoon icon in pause menu
3) fixed a little bug in the toadette balloons
4) peach body in pause screen now respects changes in powerup clothes and chars
5) fixed the problem with burn mushroom (brown one) - now it accepts custom costumes
6) Peach face with actual horny state between levels (inter level screen) - now working.
7) added 'go back to game' menu in character select (while in the level, not before playing), and a better 'NEW GAME' button mechanism.
8) peach can now start the game with the selected boob size and character type, right in the beginning.

Version 1.11 (30th june 2012):
1) NEW: more graphics and bigger watery level (thanks Luftmallow!)
2) NEW: Revamp of the credits, options, gallery and pause menu. Some with new peach bodies (by TheDirtyMonkey) in her actual power-up.
Some interesting links in the credits. Be aware that links ARE working. If its not, its your flash settings (or a security version of Flash Player alone that avoid following links). Its working okay in Explorer, Chrome and Irfanview flash player
3) Horny bar no more goes to zero in the next level. You will continue the game with the last horny situation, except when Peach loses a life.
4) Better collision in the water level
5) FIX to the 4th blopper sex scene (Peach is no more locked up there).
6) FIX to the gallery mode: Morton scene no more leads to the endings/credits
7) Better peach sounds in morton scene (no more repeated sounds)

Version 1.1:
1) NEW: Peach portrait with her horny bar (thanks TheDirtyMonkey!)
2) Players still need to press space to go to every loop in the current sex scene, but according to the horny bar and Peach desires (or when the enemy locks her). So beware of letting her horny bar full in unexpected places :P. For now, no shameful situations yet. After some seconds, the enemies let peach go away (player has to press space). All enemies' programming was changed to accept this feature.
3) NEW: Peach lactating mode (press 'SHIFT' key). Its a different way to see her going to climax, but now on her tits! If you let her play with her tits in enough time, Peach will lose a boob size. The default peach masturbation climax NO MORE let her lose a boob size.
4) NEW: Peach do-overs use 'END' key, no more DOWN or S (sorry, these were creating long and unrecoverable bugs and more than 100 lines of burden code). Also, we will use DOWN to make her crouch in the future.
5) Improved peach swimming animation, now with bubbles
6) Finally, fixed the masturbation sound when Peach uses the pipe to go down. 
7) The 'oooh' sound while masturbating returned.
8) Fixed ESC menu key (in some levels, it wasn't working).

10) zoom improvement: HUD will zoom with Peach.
11) bobombs now have 'explode' option if Peach do-over them (when they're laid down). Just press 'END'.
12) peach now starts the level 1 with cum (as she was dirty in the bed before, as Mario left her). You can clean her in the bath, on the left, or in the checkpoints.
13) inner code was implemented to allow more than one enemy next to Peach (so she will fuck one, then the other). This will be used more in some 'bonus' area full or enemies or new levels. For now, remember the enemies dont have a pure AI code yet (they just walk left/right).
14) cosmetic changes to toadette balloon text in bath area
15) some low quality sounds removed (and ghosts sounds too), those which appear to be a gun ricochet after some sex scenes.

Version 1.0u (only small changes and critical fixes):
1) Peach can jump while climbing.
2) Little fix to her hair while climbing
3) Fix to the end level 1: Peach no more walks off screen near the right castle.
4) Fixed Peach going down if you press DOWN during sex scenes with a blooper in underwater.
5) Improved Super Mario Bros 1, 2 and 3 end scenes (cosmetic changes like border changes, bigger screen size, better font)
6) Fixed a bug that let you zoom while in options / control room.
7) Peach can be zoomed in sex scenes (just press the ZOOM KEY)
8) (internal) Addition of zones/boundaries (created from scratch) to give better limits to areas whose Peach can go in a level.

Version 1.0t:
1) Fixed some bugs in the character select screen.
2) Fixed yet some bugs when pressing multiple keys at the same time of the starting sex scenes.
3) Fixed the long awaited 'red platform' (donuts) 'leak' fix. Peach no more falls 'easily' if she walks or jumps on red platforms. Be aware that a glitch still persists when Peach falls over long distances (she ignores some ground objects and keep falling). Still to be fixed. And when red platforms tremble, Peach may fall between them (this is normal, not a bug).
4) Peach jumps now with Left/Right Control Key (better response than Space key). Also, multiple jumps returned (you can maintain Control key pressed for that).
5) Removed first checkpoint right after peach castle (no reason to stay there).
6) Peach's castle (mushroom kingdom) with better floor
7) Peach backside mode! 
  - A still animation of her butt (press UP anywhere in the level and admire her bottom)
  - Going through door animation, like some Mario games (test it in the castle of the second level) Uses UP key (or 'W' key).
  - Climbing animation (you can test it in the new vines / beanstalks of Mushroom Kingdom and pre-castle level). Also uses UP key. For now, no more trees yet to climb. But the animation is done. Soon, the game will also have stairs, like Mario 2, so she can climb naked for us to see :D. 
8) Finish Pole with different fall areas. If you touch the middle of the pole, for example, you will earn less points.
9) Some adjustments in peach sounds when laid by a goomba.
10) More objects and places in the underwater level.
11) Fixed Peach swimming down if you press DOWN, when laid by a blooper in underwater.
12) New Fire Peach eye. Now its a bit purple.
13) Striker outfit by Biles added (with some corrections).
14) new sounds for swimming
15) Peach now walk slower underwater, if she is on the ground.
16) Fixed game over screen that was being skipped if you lose the last life while pressing space.
17) Peach is now buoying in the water (steady state) when she's with Frog power, and she can dive faster in this mode.
18) Peach now goes to another level if you press up in the castle door/hole (to make her enter in it).
19) Fixed collision problem in some powerups (peach has to jump to grab them)
20) Adjustments to her boobs and bras 
21) 5 boob sizes instead of 6 (the 6th boob size was too large and buggy in some situations). 
22) Fixed a glitch that makes Peach goes right to Morton castle if she dies in level 1 without finishing it (but more tests needed to assure this).
23) Better and Mario-like door sounds when opening those 'black steel doors' like in the start of level 1.

** After making 1.0j, I was getting personal troubles in life, with needs to cure a spine disease (a benign one). Moreover, I was telling myself: "I think its enough from my side, I may stop developing the game). The game would be 'completed' with only those features below. Then something happened (inner happiness? A dream?) and gave me hope to continue.

- 4 peach poses (standing, walking, jumping, and swimming).
- 3 levels.
- 23 sex scenes (1 of them was the Morton one).
- 5 interactive creatures with scenes (goombas, koopas, bloopers, bobombs and Morton).
- Peach and Fire Peach characters.
- Reconfigured the game to work with 26 FPS instead of 22
- A total of 5 outfits.


Version 1.0j (26th may 2012) 
- New: You can press 'z' to change zoom.
- New: You can press 'DEL' key to made her lose a life, if you are stuck
- New level: underwater. It uses Luftmallow's map as a base.
- New songs: underwater, castle mario3, and mario 2 underlevel (SWF increased by 1mb, but these songs will be reused in special areas). Better music loop in mushroom kingdom and castle.
- New peach animation: going through horizontal pipes.
- New peach animation: swimming (in the near future, frog animation will be different (squatting), like in Mario 3)
- New and better sounds, like 'cum squish'
- New enemy: piranha plant with sound (no sex animations yet, it will depend on future features)
- Now, peach will lose her cum over her body if she loses a life
- Removed a brick which can let Peach locked in the sky pipes in level 1.
- Changed positions of old toad balloons and 'picture teaching how to zoom', in the first level, because it was hidden by the roof.
- Better masturbation handling. Now you can cancel it if you try to walk. To keep masturbating until orgasm, just press down. Peach will only lose a boob size if you let her masturbate until the end.
- Fixed a bug that made peach go to the morton castle level instead of level 2, when jumping over goomba after the pole.
- Fixed a glitch which made Peach gain two lives instead of one when taking Life Mushroom
- Fixed a glitch which made Peach break bricks even going down of a jump (more tests needed, though)
- Fixed 'locked peach jumping animation loop' that can occur sometimes (you had to press UP or W to free her).
- Fixed a bug that made peach without any animation if she stands up pointing left
- Fixed a bug that can make peach lose her clothes AND her life at the same time in some enemy objects, like fire wheels.
- Cosmetic changes to brown castle keep image like in the end of level 1 (based on Super Mario 1).
- Cosmetic change: Peach breasts' shadow more smoothly curvaceous.
- Cosmetic changes in char select, and the return of Character selection bar, in order to be able to use Fire Peach and Burn. This way, you can use normal princess clothes (pink one) in Burn Peach character, for example.

Version 1.0a: (29th april 2012)
1) Fork with Blargh version accomplished!
2) no star aura (the plan is to have a normal star powerup that let her blink and be invencible)
3) no credits in the throne (you can see it in the starting screen of the game or the main menu)
4) new 'change level screen' background
5) new sub-level (pre-castle) with some new graphics (resembling Mario World), but you can control Peach in this area
6) new end-level in mushroom level, with an animated pole
7) better jumping animation
8) better standing animation (like breathing)
9) better animation on pipes
10) ceiling collision (it does its job but may not be 100% perfect). This is NOT block/ground collision.
11) Better and more natural colors for goomba and koopa, according to mario games
12) Also, correction to Peach hair, breast size and shadows (let me informed if its better or not)
13) peach will lose a boob size if she is hit by an enemy (deprecated in later versions. Its better to lose a boob size when killed or if she's lactating)
14) each powerup has different score points. Dress powerup has the least. The original plan was to have Dress Peach remove 500 points, but this was cancelled because this was a kind of punishment and I want to let it at minimum. So everything will earn you points. Gather and Exchange outfits if you want to earn the most points
15) small speed change in each boob size. The heaviest boob size will make her slow, but she will be able to jump and pass most obstacles
16) new zoom mode. Now 4 zooms in total. The fourth zoom is actually a zoom out
17) new graphic mode: LOW (pressing Q or pressing the buttons in the start level)
18) fixed the bug of 'double peach' if you jump and then goes into a scene (like old toad or goomba)
19) (internal) font optimization
20) You can use SPACE BAR to skip intro scenes (like 'Morton is Invading') and go right into the first level
21) ESC key will go to menu. While pressing down (masturbation), the key 'UP' will cancel it, instead of DOWN again
22) Cancelled the idea of CONTINUING the level stats when losing a life. Thats because it will interfere with a new checkpoint system and the way the game will be made (its also better retain the original Mario: make the blocks and everything restart positions when Peach loses a life)
23) (deactivated): 'POST situations of the same levels' (like reverse castle and underwater): The reverse castle will not be present anymore (I will create and use new levels), and the underwater area will appear as a new level as well.
24) Internal Cum working but its desactivated by default. You can re-enable it in the menu.

Version 0 to 0.9 (January 2012 to April 2012): Dark age.
1) Learning Flash AS2 from scratch
2) Understanding Mario is Missing game from Playshapes.
3) Made experiments with outfit varieties to Peach
4) Added the 'breaking blocks' feature
5) Added transition animations while in pipes, with Peach poses (entering/leaving them).
6) Recolor and optimization to Peach art.
7) Improvement to Blargh's HUD, making it small (H key: hide/show).
